About the Program
</b></p><p>The Google AI Residency Program (Healthcare) is a 12-month role designed to advance your career in machine learning research. Residents will work alongside distinguished scientists and engineers from the medical and healthcare teams, as well as collaborate with other Research teams. The goal of the residency is to help residents become successful AI researchers.
</p><p>You have a background in healthcare and want to learn to conduct machine learning research in collaboration with our researchers. You may have research experience in another field (e.g., a medical specialty, epidemiology, healthcare delivery science, genomics, clinical informatics, bioinformatics, etc.) and want to apply machine learning to this area. Of course, already having machine learning research experience is great.
</p><p>Participants must be able to commit to the full year of the program, on-site. Current doctoral students must graduate from their program before the residency begins. Physicians who are in residency or fellowship must either complete their training program before the AI Residency begins or be able to commit to a 12-month program (e.g., as part of a dedicated research year). We encourage candidates from all over the world to apply. If a candidate requires a work visa, Google will explore what options are available on a case-by-case basis.
</p><p>The Google AI Residency Program (Healthcare) is based in the Bay Area and Residents will be expected to work on-site.</p>
<p>We do research differently here at Google. Our teams of Research Scientists are embedded throughout the engineering organization, allowing them to setup large-scale tests and deploy ideas quickly and broadly. Ideas may come from internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, Research Scientists work on real-world problems including artificial intelligence, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more. You may also stay connected to your research roots as an active contributor to the wider research community by partnering with universities and publishing papers.</p><p><b>

As a Google Research Scientist, you will continue to be an active contributor to the wider research community by collaborating with academic researchers and by publishing papers.
</p><p>Researchers on the Google Brain team have the freedom to set their research agenda and to engage as much or as little as they wish with existing products, choosing between doing more basic, methodological research or more applied research as necessary to produce the most compelling results. Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.
</p><p>The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems. We have resources and access to projects impossible to find elsewhere. Our broad and fundamental research goals allow us to collaborate closely with and–contribute uniquely to–many different product teams across the company.</p></div><div><div><div>

Product Designer,Quora,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><div>Each of us has unique expertise. Whether it's the subject of a doctoral thesis, advice for dealing with life's stresses, tips for what to do in a neighborhood, or reactions to current events, our knowledge has the potential to transform lives for the better. Despite this, we rarely think to share that knowledge with others. That's where Quora comes in.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
We're creating a repository for all human knowledge. To do that, we need to design systems that make sharing knowledge rewarding and discovering it easy; that show you answers to questions you didn't know you had, on topics you didn't know you liked; and that scale to support the participation of the entire planet. Designing a global ecosystem for knowledge sharing requires a multidisciplinary approach and a diverse team, empowered to shape strategy while moving quickly and learning as much as possible.</div><div><br>

Quora designers are thoughtful generalists. As a product designer, you'll be responsible for what you design from start to finish: brainstorming solutions, iterating on visuals and interactions however you see fit, and finally implementing your designs in code yourself (no middlemen required!). You work on everything from ranking to UI, from internationalization to moderation systems. Your design decisions are validated through A/B testing and user studies alike, as we value rigor and empathy in equal measure.</div><div><br>
