<br><br>
About the Role
<br><br>
Senior Software Engineers at Civis amplify the contributions of their colleagues by leading engineering teams or tackling our hardest, riskiest, or most complex technical projects. Depending on interest, roles for senior engineers may focus on team leadership or individual contribution; either way we’re looking for judgment, ownership, and autonomy. At Civis, you will be responsible for making good choices about technical questions, and also about what technical projects are worth pursuing. You will play an outsized role in making Civis a great place to build great software products.
<br><br>
What's great about being an engineer at Civis? We believe in ownership of our work and continuous learning, and we run our team to reinforce those values.
<br><br>
We trust engineers from all over our team to pick the right architecture, library, or framework for the job at hand. They help make decisions about new products in cross-functional design sprints and take quarterly hack weeks to try out new ideas and new technologies. Civis engineers push code to production on their second day and quickly ramp up on projects of increasing responsibility. We’re looking for senior engineers to make a big impact in their first few months.
<br><br>
We want to never stop learning. Everyone has a mentor from day one and tracks their personal development alongside their technical deliverables. We staff projects based on what people will learn, not just who knows it best today. Engineers collaborate across departments with our data scientists and analysts who are not only the best and brightest in their fields, but are also eager to teach and learn from you. Finally, valuing continuous learning also means recognizing that our strongest contributors stand out for their capabilities and not their credentials.
<br><br>
We are smart, fun, and a little bit weird. Does this sound like you?
<br><br>
We are looking for detail-oriented individuals from diverse backgrounds with demonstrated quantitative and problem-solving skills. We value creativity, hard work and on-the-job-excellence and offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States.

"Customer Success Manager (Enterprise, Channel Partnership)",Rippleshot,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>Ever had your credit or debit card stolen? Or maybe had your card declined at a store for seemingly no reason? You are not alone. It happens to millions of consumers at the merchants they shop at every day. Which is why we built Rippleshot. We detect the data breaches that cause these problems faster than anyone else in the market (we are freaky fast, to be exact), which means consumers can be alerted earlier, and banks, credit unions and merchants can act on the breaches quicker than ever before, and in smarter ways.</p>
<p>Three years ago we were the new kids on the block. Today, dozens of banks, credit unions, and billion dollar companies trust us to help them fight fraud. Always smarter, always faster. And we are not done. The fraudsters are good. We need to be better.</p>

</p><p>And that’s just the tip of the spear. We believe a tsunami of fraud is headed our way over the next five years. We think we have the winning combination of analytics, machine learning, big data, and people to protect our clients from these evolving threats. It’s a race and we are all in!</p>

Following a “build to think” approach, front-end software developers at IDEO bring our designs to life. Colleagues in this role will design software with a diverse range of fidelity; from quick and dirty user experience prototypes, designed to facilitate research interviews, to fully-fledged, public software products that have a direct impact on end-users. Software Design colleagues have the opportunity to explore projects that span mobile to desktop; wearables to interactive installations.<br>

About the Role
<br><br>
Civis Analytics is building cloud-based products to help organizations do data science better and more easily. As a Product Manager, you will work with our Engineering, Design, Data Science, Sales, and Marketing teams to drive the conception, development, and launch of new software products and to enhance existing products.
<br><br>
This particular role is focused on building B2B products for Media Attribution and Optimization. This includes launching products that solve business problems for omni-channel media mix and using data science to attribute outcomes feeding back into optimization. We aim to solve these core business problems by bringing not only data and science, but the scientific method into the products we launch.
<br><br>
You love working hard to make products as amazing as possible for customers. You have an image of what 5 years from now looks like and you can separate it from what 6 months from now needs to look like. You’ve got a honed attention to detail; we want you to care about the small things just as much as the big things. You have prior success defining and launching excellent features and/or product improvements. You can pull off that delicate balancing act of prioritizing competing opportunities (including evaluating customer needs within our business priorities). You are a pro at communication, from the articulation of a product use case all the way to writing a blog post to describe its release. You’re social and adept at building relationships across product lines and functional groups to make sure we are all on the same page.

We specialize in strategy, portfolio management and product design, combined with digital engineering excellence.
<br><br>
As a Lead Data Engineer, here's what we'll be looking for you to bring:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Hands-on Engineering Leadership</li>
<li>Proven track record of Innovation and expertise in Data Engineering</li>
<li>Tenure in coding, architecting and delivering complex projects</li>
<li>Deep understanding and application of modern data processing technology stacks. For example Spark, Hadoop ecosystem technologies, and others</li>
<li>Deep understanding of streaming data architectures and technologies for real-time and low-latency data processing</li>
<li>Deep understanding of NoSQL technologies including column family, graph, document, and key-value data storage technologies</li>

<li>Passion for software craftsmanship</li>
<li>A rich breadth of industry experience and background working across different organizations, ranging in size, from start-ups to large corporations..</li>
<li>Strong stakeholder management and interaction experience at different levels</li>
</ul>
There's no typical day or engagement for our Senior Data Engineers. Here’s what you’ll do:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Be the SME. Develop modern data architectural approaches to meet key business objectives and provide end to end data solutions</li>
<li>You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organizational review, helping them to understand the potential that data brings to solve their most pressing problems.</li>
<li>On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a program inception to build a new product.</li>
<li>It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution.</li>
<li>Whatever your role, the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue delivering without undue pressure.</li>
<li>You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.</li>
<li>You recognize that building your network with a client is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role.

</ul>
<b>A few important things to know:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people’s personal situations into account, but we know it’s not for everyone.</li>
<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.</li>
</ul>
