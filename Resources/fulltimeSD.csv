<p>ASML brings together the most creative minds in science and technology to develop lithography machines that are key to producing faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient microchips. We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers - the world’s leading chipmakers – to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Our headquarters are in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, and we have 18 office locations around the United States. We are currently recruiting for internships located at our office in San Diego, CA<br>
(EUV laser source creation).<br>
<br>
As the world’s leading semiconductor lithography machine (the machine that makes computer chips) manufacturer, ASML enables chip manufacturers to make cheaper, faster, chips, thereby enabling all the technology you use today. The machines we make require high speed, magnetically levitated stages with sub-nanometer accuracy, robotic mask delivery systems, mechatronic devices to shape and correct the laser illumination source, and optical modules that can detect sub-nanometer alignment errors and pattern distortions. Temperature controlled to milli-kelvins, particulate free, and operating in complete vacuum, the technical challenges are endless. Solving these requires expertise in servo controls, mechatronics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, embedded software engineering, optics, physics, manufacturing, industrialization, and more. If you like extreme challenges and want to help bring the next generation of technology to the world, then come join ASML.<br>
<br>
If you have a passion for technology and innovation you’ll want to check us out. Be a part of ASML. Be a part of progress.</p><p>

Job Mission</b></h2></div>
<p>We are looking for a Software Test Engineer who has a passion for testing software for a distributed control system. Join Cymer/ASML and you will be joining a team that operates in a fast-paced, uniquely innovative and challenging environment to create new-to-industry solutions with rapid productization to support an aggressive commercialization plan for the EUV technology within ASML.<br>
<br>
You will work with software architects, function architects, software test engineers and software developers. You will be instrumental in customer test profiling, software test automation roadmap, test automation framework, and requirements reviews and validations. You can also be hands on to create test cases and test plans, as well as develop smoke tests, regression tests and software validation tests. You will help software test engineers determine the best test approach to ensure that delivered controls and software sub-systems meets all its functional requirements, by helping delivering automated test capabilities, employing best in class software quality management tools, ensuring complete software test coverage with the ultimate goal being the superior quality and on-time delivery of the controls and software sub-systems.<br>
<br>
You may ask, what does the control system software do? Well, the control loops involve data exchange at speeds up to 100 kHz while data collection for diagnostics purposes is done at up to 1Khz rate. There is interaction between control loops running on quad core boards and platform software that runs on IBM bladecenter. Data is stored on board in postgres databases and is shipped via the fab network to data servers in San Diego. And our graphical user interface developed using Qt serves a complex set of users - operators, engineers, scientists and customers. And we don't forget safety, the control system has a Siemens PLC to ensure both human safety is ensured and machine damage is prevented.<br>
<br>
Come and join our journey and you will be challenged and rewarded as you work alongside a group of talented, passionate and fun-loving engineers. You can tell your friends – I work on semiconductor lithography machines that allow the printing of finer features for the next generation of chips that power the innovations in the world today.</p><br>
