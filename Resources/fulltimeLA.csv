<p>
Changing the established guidelines of an industry, especially one as rooted as digital advertising, isn't an easy or quick effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do and we want to be the ones to do it. We're looking for hungry people who are passionate about redefining the digital video and media world, from how consumers experience it to how content creators fund it.</p><br>
<p>
We work hard at true[X], and we believe in fostering an open, collaborative, motivating, creative culture for our team; put simply, our employees love to come to work. We have all the perks you can expect from a startup environment, including a sunlit rooftop patio, corn hole and ping pong, and a stocked pantry and fridge.</p><br>
<p>
The true[X] technology team is a bit of an anomaly in the tech world: Once people join us, they tend to stick around. Our leadership has been a part of this company for 10+ years (since the beginning), and our turnover is exceptionally low.</p><br>
<p>
You can ask individual members their thoughts, but this dedication generally comes down to two factors. First, the people: We hire smart, driven, accountable, and friendly individuals. We all appreciate and are proud of the culture we’ve created here, and it’s in no small part due to our high hiring standards. Second (and this point cannot be understated): There is a endless supply of engaging engineering work to be done. Our engineers are constantly expanding their knowledge and experience, whether it be exploring a new language on a hackday, learning the internals of various cloud platforms, or leveraging new tools to work with our “Big (and growing!) Data"". Boredom doesn’t exist here.</p><br>
<p>
Our leadership takes pride in fostering a sustainable software development cadence. No artificial deadlines. No guilting our team into staying late. And no micromanagement. We use the best tools to get the job done, end of story. We communicate via Slack (mostly emojis and gifs, really). We like testing. We have an aversion to meetings. You get the hardware you prefer (within reason) to make you as productive as possible. We want you to be happy, and stay a valuable team member for a long time to come.</p><br>

As a Data Scientist, you will be joining one of the most innovative teams at true[X]. As an AdTech company, data is our lifeblood, and there's a lot of it. Every data scientist wants to get his/her hands on large and interesting data sets, and we can deliver that and more. We do cutting edge ad optimization, and that's the tip of the iceberg.

Players form the foundation of our community and it’s for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.
<br><br>
We’re looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; you’re passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, aren’t afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
<br><br>
That’s where you come in.
<br><br>
As a Researcher, you’ll join the Insights discipline – the group of researchers, analysts, data scientists, and strategists responsible for solving problems and executing analyses that enable Rioters to make difficult decisions with confidence. You’ll be part of a product team and work closely with designers and producers to create and conduct studies that’ll inform the features, systems, and experiences of our games. Your applied or experimental research background coupled with your deep understanding of data will ensure that you’re an effective advocate for players and can provide strategic guidance about their wants, needs, and behaviors.

<li>Strategic and business-savvy: you’re well aware that there’s no point in analyzing every aspect of a problem if the decision hinges on one critical insight; you’re sharp about what makes a company like Riot tick and can find the critical path to how Riot can deliver meaningful experiences to players.</li>
<li>Data-informed: you creatively construct ways to scientifically measure any issue through targeted research; you meticulously analyze results, converting them into actionable insights</li>
<li>An equipped communicator: you’re comfortable using Excel, Powerpoint, and/or Tableau; you’re capable of translating raw data into reports and presentations that are clear and concise, and delivering them to a variety of audiences</li>

Senior Learning Scientist,Imbellus,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p><b>Imbellus Overview</b></p>
<p>We are looking for exceptional people who share our mission: to reinvent how we measure human potential. At Imbellus, we build technology-enabled assessments that evaluate how people think instead of what they know. We believe our society must prioritize developing minds that do what computers cannot. By changing assessments, we reorient the education system and employers to measure what matters.</p>
<p>We love this challenge. We know that what has worked for decades in other contexts, might not work in ours. So we don’t default on expertise, instead we test every assumption with logic, each idea with reasoning, and all conclusions with “prove it.” We choose learning over ego so that our product and our people become the best.</p>
<p>You’ll probably enjoy working with us if</p>
<ul><li>You’re a systems thinker; you’d rather debate the concept than argue the example; you prize logic and reason</li>
<li>You’re restless when not learning something new or stretching yourself</li>
<li>You understand that at a fast-growing startup, priorities may shift rapidly. You value exposure across functions and are prepared to work on whichever team or goal is most impactful.</li>
<li>You’re willing to open-mindedly challenge your own and others’ ideas, but also commit to the ultimate direction when the time comes</li>
<li>You feel accountable and hold others to a high standard</li>
</ul><p><b>We’re looking for a Senior Learning Scientist</b>
<br>
<br>
Given that we are designing a new, cognitive-based assessment, learning science research stands at the core of our design and development process. As we expand the scope of cognitive and non-cognitive capabilities we aim to assess for a broad set of clientele, we are seeking a talented, theoretically-minded Senior Learning Scientist who can initiate and collaborate on research plans that inform the design and evaluation of our simulation-based assessments.</p>
<p><b>What you’ll be doing at Imbellus:</b></p>
<ul><li>Needfinding and Definitional Research conducting extensive literature reviews, developing initial frameworks and models, building ontologies</li>
<li>Employing research methods that are experimental/quasi, descriptive, and/or qualitative, including study design, data collection, analysis &amp; reporting</li>
<li>Engaging in inter-rater agreement on framework design, structural analyses, and construct mapping</li>
<li>Mapping constructs across Imbellus and client models</li>
<li>Heavily collaborating with other Senior Scientists and the Game Design Team</li>
<li>Defining best practices at the intersection of learning science and game research and development</li>
<li>Working closely with the Data Science team to define and validate expert models and telemetry scores</li>
</ul><p><b>What you’ll need to succeed at Imbellus:</b></p>
<ul><li>PhD, EdD, or ABD (with intent to complete) in Educational Psychology, Educational Technology, Instructional Design, Learning Design, Cognitive Psychology, Psychology, or other research-based fields in learning science</li>
<li>Understanding of cognitive and motivational aspects of learning and assessment</li>
<li>Strong familiarity and interest in games or other interactive media for learning and assessment</li>
<li>Experience leading research and/or R&amp;D studies (emphasis on qualitative research preferred)</li>
<li>Competent with SPSS or other statistical analysis program(s)</li>
<li>Experience with research in affective capabilities is a bonus</li>
<li>Experience with research on simulation and/or game-based learning and assessment preferred</li>

Smarkets is Python and Erlang technology company based in central London, Malta and now Los Angeles. We've built one of the world's largest betting exchanges, also known as a prediction market, with significantly better odds than the competition. Our strength is technology and trading with a passion to push the known boundaries of real-time financial technology.
<br><br>
We're a growing team of over 100, boasting more than 30 nationalities, and we are looking to build out our team in Downtown Los Angeles. Our platform has handled over £3 billion of bets since launching in 2010, allowing us to become one of the most profitable companies per employee in Europe.
<br><br>
Our mission is to disrupt one of the oldest industries in the world by rethinking the method and model of the betting business. We think traditional sports betting rips off bettors, taking up to a 15% margin on bets. We offer the industry's lowest margin of around 2%. We can and will do better.
<br><br>
We're building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent system capable of scaling to thousands of executions per second with sub-millisecond latency. Whether you want to work on the exchange platform, the front-end or trading mechanisms, you'll be solving real and challenging problems - from pushing Python performance to new heights to handling real-time design constraints.
<br><br>
The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. We deploy to production several times a day.
<br><br>
Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Ansible - but we are not resistant to change when it's needed.
<br><br>
Smarkets prides itself on collecting individuals seeking challenge, and our team members' experiences show this. Come join former financial and adtech engineers, researchers, scientists, and PhDs at one of the most dynamic fintech startups.
