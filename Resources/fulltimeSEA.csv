UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.
<br>
<br>
UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for five consecutive years.
<br>
<br>
<b>UW eScience Institute</b> has an outstanding opportunity for an <b>Researcher, Human-centered Data Science.</b>
<br>
<br>
The <b>UW eScience Institute’s</b> mission is to engage researchers across disciplines in developing and applying advanced techniques and technologies to real-world problems in data-intensive science. In conjunction with the eScience Institute, the School of Computer Science and Engineering seeks an outstanding research scientist with expertise in the application of human-centered approaches to data science and the ethnography of data-intensive practices. This position will take a leadership role in the implementation of these approaches and practices at the eScience Institute and will also run the annual Data Science for Social Good summer program.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Researcher, Human-centered Data Science</b> is an outstanding leader and interdisciplinary scholar who will contribute to the development of human-centered data science programs and practices at the University of Washington, co-lead the Data Science Studies working group within the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at UW, and produce scholarly research on the ethnography of data science. The ideal candidate will exhibit: an ability to thrive in highly interdisciplinary research environments; experience conducting ethnographic fieldwork and using a range of qualitative methods; a passion for producing scholarly research on sociotechnical practices; and expertise in applying qualitative insights to inform data-intensive, computational work.
<br>
<br>
The successful candidate will participate in programs involving software development, technical consulting, workshops and training, and other activities designed to advance the research and practice of data-driven decision-making and data-intensive discovery. The position will also entail the execution of an ongoing research program using ethnographic and applied, practice-based, action-oriented research methods to investigate the practice and culture of data science. There will be ample opportunity to publish results, though the role will be evaluated as much by alternative metrics as by conventional metrics of publishing in traditional scholarly venues.

<br>
The Researcher, Human-centered Data Science will work collaboratively within eScience, across departments and academic units at UW, and with organizations and institutions beyond campus, including other universities, government agencies, and industry partners. This position requires excellent collaboration and communication skills, especially when engaging across disciplines and with those in more technical fields. Candidates must have a demonstrated record of independent and collaborative interdisciplinary research, and have the potential to successfully pursue external funding.
<br>
<br>
Approximately 55 percent will be dedicated to human-centered data science research activities, and approximately 45 percent of the Researcher, Human-centered Data Science’s time will be spent on action research commitments in support of eScience programs and initiatives. However, given the applied, practice-based, action-oriented nature of the research study, there is significant overlap and synergy between these two objectives.

<br>
</li><li>Provide mentorship to students and staff, including acting as an advisor and resource for sophisticated qualitative methodologies.
<br>
<br>
<i>Action Research/Programmatic Commitments</i>
<br>
</li><li>Contribute human-centered data science expertise to bridge social and technical perspectives in eScience programs and initiatives, including taking on a leadership role in implementing the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) program.

Data Scientist,Zume Inc.,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary"">WHO WE ARE
<br><br>
Zume is on a quest to be the most powerful source of health and well-being on the planet. We started by partnering people with technology to create a more thoughtful and efficient way to source, make, bake and deliver pizza. In the process, we are delivering an artisan pizza that takes care of the people who eat it and make it, and even takes better care of the planet we all love—a planet 9 billion people will inhabit by mid-century.
<br><br>
The health and well-being of people and our planet is dependent upon sustainably feeding that population with wholesome, affordable food on a global scale. Zume is meeting this challenge with an end-to-end, scalable platform that reduces the time and distance between clean food sources and dense population centers, using cutting-edge automation and transportation logistics. By developing better tools and processes, we can feed people healthier, sustainably-grown food, delivered fresh and free from chemical stabilization.
<br><br>
We have an employee-first philosophy and we’re deeply committed to investing in the happiness, satisfaction and success of everyone we work with. We are looking for a team who feels the same way! Join us as we change the way people think about food.

THE ROLE
<br><br>
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it with Pizza now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.
<br><br>
The problem we need to solve is a combination of Uber's ride scheduling problem with Amazon's autonomous supply chain problem, but to make things more tricky food needs to show up freshly prepared, so timing is critical. And that just the tip of the iceberg of where we're going. To scale we're going to need to solve lot of really hard problems that call for a world class data science team. That’s where you come in.
<br><br>
You should have a broad understanding of data science in general, but we're also looking for specialists in at least one of (convex) optimization, stochastic processes, time series, and machine learning. Graduate work in any of these fields is a plus. You'll need to be proficient in programming (python), and not afraid to get your hands dirty in implementation. Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
</div></div><div>People issue over 2 billion searches on Facebook every day to find people, pages, videos, and connect with the communities and interests that matter to them. Facebook Search team is working to build a global, general-purpose search engine that leverages the unique content and social connections on Facebook. By unlocking the unique information and connections available on Facebook, we believe we can provide a more meaningful experience for people around the world, especially in mobile-first countries. To achieve our goal, we need to solve some of the most challenging engineering problems in the industry, across areas such as Infrastructure, Product, Mobile, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
<br>
Being a complex engineering system, Facebook Search depends on several machine learning models and heavy natural language processing. Understanding the user's search intent from their search query is crucial to retrieving and matching the right content from Facebook's vast amount of social data. NLP team focuses on developing various machine learning technologies to process and transform a search query into a form that is utilized by the subsequent systems for retrieval and ranking. Context of the search query and its implicit and explicit semantics play an important role in satisfying the searcher's information need. Similar technologies are utilized to decipher the meaning and intent of the content in Facebook to create the matching between user intent and content.
<br>
A Data Scientist in this role will leverage his knowledge and understanding of these technologies along with the vast and powerful search dataset in order to: (1) provide tactical engineering systems development guidance by bridging lower level NLP system components' performance to higher level product performance (2) perform various forms of opportunity analyses to influence NLP systems development roadmap and (3) collaborate with software engineers to help develop better ways of understanding search queries and content on Facebook. This is a key role within the greater search team and it requires heavy involvement with technical aspects of the core search technology.

Operations Research Scientist,Amazon.com,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Job Description
</b></h2><div><div><div>Take hundreds of millions of shipments, a gigantic fulfillment network, reliable premium delivery service and optimizing decisions on transportation cost (involving billions of dollars in transportation spend). Combine this with the opportunity to be a key research leader and individual contributor building innovative transportation capabilities for the world’s most customer-centric company and what do you get? The best optimization R&amp;D role- period.<br>
<br>
The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors, third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandise from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection – merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs – this selection is key to Amazon’s virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers; this involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, this presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.<br>
<br>
Modeling and Optimization team is responsible for building network optimization models and analytic tools that improve the economics of the North American, European, and Asian fulfillment networks as Amazon increases the speed and decreases the cost to deliver product to customers. We are looking for motivated individuals with strong numerical optimization and analysis skills to join our team focusing on transportation network modeling and design. You will be responsible for building tools to determine the means to efficiently transport shipments from vendors to our fulfillment centers, as well as from fulfillment centers to our customers. In particular, you will focus on building models that will be leveraged to drive the optimization of the transportation infrastructure, transportation contract negotiation, increase speed of delivery and evaluate opportunities to decrease cost through new initiatives. Some of the key job responsibilities<br>
Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with the transportation network including network optimization, process improvement and sizing up opportunities from new initiatives. Build prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to the decision systems and operational processes.<br>
<br>
Partner closely with business and IT groups. Provide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to benchmark existing operations/processes as well as to identify opportunities for improvement. Work closely with IT teams in enhancing the prototypes and implementing them in our production environment.<br>
Effectively communicate with senior management as well as with colleagues from computer science, operations research and business backgrounds.<br>
<br>
A proven history of driving critical research and development, algorithms and optimization is needed to be successful in this role.<br>

<b>HCDE</b> has an outstanding opportunity for a <b>Research Scientist.</b>
<br>
<br>
Working with Dr. David Ribes, the Research Scientist will contribute to research activities outlined in NSF award “Knowledge Infrastructures for Sustainable Transitions”. The project proceeds in two broad phases of iterative field research and document collection - the research scientist (RS) will be a collaborator working under the supervision of Dr. Ribes, the PI. The first phase will focus on exploring available archival documentary evidence (proposals, reports, etc). Using archival data the PI and RS will trace the formation and initial development of each organization. At the same time the PI and research scientist will conduct exploratory ethnography at selected local sites. Through field research and interviews this research will examine the current state of each organization, and how members reflexively work to prepare for the future. Document collection and preliminary interviews will be designed to build and test preliminary couplings between the entire organization and local site activity.
<br>
<br>
In a second iteration of research will return to field sites and archival data to target specific concepts for theoretical elaboration. The grounded theory methodology is iterative, demanding several returns to the field and data in order to ‘theoretically sample,’ or investigate features that require more data to understand them. In the second phase of the project, the PI and RS will conduct a second iteration of field research within each project. The second phase of the project will continue (but scale down) ethnographic and targeted archival research in the follow-on sites, while focusing on project outreach, education, and publication.

Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies. Our Senior Leadership team has been recognized by Forbes, Seattle Business, and Geekwire. We've been named among Seattle's ""Best Places to Work"" in Seattle Met magazine, Seattle Business Magazine, and the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2016 and 2017. We're also the recipient of World’s Most Dog-Friendly Offices in 2016 by Inc.com.

The Senior Data Scientist at Rover will possess broad enough experience to contribute to each of the three classes of problem outlined above, while also being deep enough to lead at least one of them end-to-end. In every case, and regardless of the specific techniques employed, the Senior Data Scientist will be responsible for managing long-running experiments with significant impact on how users interact with Rover.com, participate in our marketplace, and find care for their dogs. This is a non-trivial responsibility: on the one hand, there is tremendous value to be driven in continuing to optimize the Rover marketplace, while on the other hand the opportunity cost associated with long-running experiments (in time and dollars) is very high.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
For this reason, real-world experience in this class of problem is a requirement, and experience working in an online marketplace specifically is strongly preferred.</div><div><br>
</div><div><b>
What does Data Science mean at Rover?</b></div><div><br>
</div><div>
There are three broad classes of core Data Science problems with which we are engaged at Rover:</div><div><br>

</div><div>
2. Machine learning: the ongoing development of the machine learning infrastructure that enables continuous learning from our data, where success is also measured in terms of marketplace efficiency gains as well as the rate at which different aspects of the user experience are incorporated into our ML systems</div><div><br>
</div><div>
3. Scaling user testing: the parallelization and democratization of end-user testing across all aspects of the product and user experience, where success is measured in terms of testing velocity across the organization</div></div>

</b></h2><div><div><div>Recommending products to Amazon customers – yes, that is the space that we work in. We blend a variety of disciplines (such as recommender systems, data mining, NLP, big data and ML) to turn an intractable problem into a hard problem. For example: just because someone bought a purple dress does not mean that purple is the right color for them for all seasons; neither does it mean that you should recommend purple accessories. Just when someone buys a sofa, which rug in Amazon’s vast selection would it make most sense to pair with it? While there are other recommendation problems out there, none of them capture the scale of the problem, the rapidly changing inventory along with unique problems of fit, fabric and finish.<br>
<br>
So how do we do it? We are a full stack team that own components all the way from dataset generation, high performance service oriented architecture to building great UIs that can surface recommendations in a pleasing and aesthetically appealing way.

You will own and build infrastructure that accesses terabyte of data to produce and deliver datasets with low latency and high reliability. The goal is to innovate new discovery features that can make a huge impact on the customer experience. What recommendations data could you use to make search more personalized? How can we use product similarity and sales data to augment and enrich our recommendations? How can we influence customers to drive long term value to Amazon?<br>
We are looking for people who innovate, love solving hard problems, understand both technology and business, and have a great judgement skills. You will be able to build systems that will impact millions of customers and create multi-million dollar revenue opportunities, ship in just a couple of weeks and instantly measure the impact of what you have developed. And be able to go home and show your friends and family how you change the world!<br>

Due to the increase in volume of research IT collaborative projects being generated by the organization (e.g. Clinical Data 2 Health Center, Kidney Precision Medicine, etc.), UW Medicine has determined that a new program needs to be implemented. The Research IT Program ('RIT Program') will focus on managing the Research IT components of these large collabortive research projects. Implementing a centralized program will allow for better prioritization and coordination of necessary Research IT resources across multiple projects and entities because many of these resources are shared by all research projects. This increased coordination will help to eliminate project resource collisions between concurrent projects, to better coordinate timing of projects, and to raise awareness of all of the research project work occurring.
<br>
<br>
We are seeking a Research IT Program Manager ('Program Manager') to provide leadership, development and management to the RIT Program.

In addition, this position will be in contact with sensitive patient information and must ensure that appropriate business processes and procedures are followed in accordance with local, Washington state, and US Federal compliance regulations.

</b></h2><div><div><div>Amazon's Advertising Platform is positioned to grow its share of the online advertising industry due to its unique combination of online retail behavior data, industry-leading cloud services, and a fast-moving startup culture. The targeting platform enables our ad systems to deliver the right ads to the right users. To accomplish this goal, we are applying the latest low latency, big data technologies and toolsets which allow us to understand our users interests and personalize their experiences.<br>
<br>
About you:<br>
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack - from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.<br>
<br>
Some problem spaces we'll be working on:<br>
<br>
TARGETING - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. This data can be used to help us decide what else they are likely to be interested in and to respond to. Accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. . You will be working with other driven engineers to deliver our features and solutions. This will require core engineering and programming skills, insight, technical capability, data driven decision making, creativity and an obsession to ship high quality solutions for our customers.<br>
<br>
MACHINE LEARNING &amp; ANALYTICS - there's an almost overwhelming amount of data available, and we need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict any measurable signal. You will be working in the designing, building and finally shipping these products together with partners, product management, other engineers and data scientists.<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER FACING TOOLS - all our processes are driven through a toolset that we have built. You will establish the roadmap for our customer facing functionalities, ensure prioritization and ultimately build these features. Shipping a high quality toolset always requires being data driven and having strong engineering skills. You need to be obsessed with ensuring the best end to end experience for our customers.<br>
<br>
As a TPM, you will anticipate bottlenecks, provide escalation management, anticipate and make trade-offs, and balance the business needs versus technical constraints. An ability to take large, complex projects and break them down into manageable pieces, develop functional specifications, then deliver them in a successful and timely manner is expected. Maturity, high judgment, negotiation skills, ability to influence, analytical talent, and leadership are essential to success in this role.<br>

"Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, Computational Biology",Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Overview
</b></h2><div><div><div><div>Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here</div><br>
<ul><li>
We have an open postdoc position in the lab of Dr. Frederick (Erick) A. Matsen of at least two years duration with solid pay and great benefits</li><li>
The project is to learn about anti-HIV antibody development and coevolution using data coming from a unique HIV superinfection cohort for which the viral history has been carefully characterized</li><li>
There will be many opportunities to develop and deploy new methods in a team pushing the boundaries of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis</li><li>
We will work with collaborators to validate inferences using lab techniques</li><li>
The larger research group is highly collaborative, with deep expertise in virology, protein evolution, and structural/functional analysis</li><li>
We’re a Python shop looking for someone who isn’t afraid of large-scale data analysis and has high standards for organization and code clarity</li></ul><div>
This is a unique time, full of opportunity, to be working on B cell receptor (antibody) sequences. The field is awash with data, and methods haven’t really caught up: there is still lots to do to develop methods that fully make use of the data but also scale to large data sets.</div><br>
<div>
The Fred Hutch is also a unique place to be doing this work, with a convergence of many very strong research programs. This project is a collaborative endeavor between</div><ul><li>
Julie Overbaugh’s lab brings decades of experience analyzing HIV infection and the corresponding immune response.</li><li>
Jesse Bloom’s lab does groundbreaking work understanding protein evolution at the pathogen-immune interface; they recently did deep mutational scanning on HIV env, influenza in the presence of antibody selection and are gearing up to do more in HIV, including DMS on anti-HIV antibodies.</li><li>
Kelly Lee’s lab brings a full stack of cutting-edge technology to study virus/immune reactions from a structural perspective.</li><li>
My group works to develop advanced Bayesian phylogenetic techniques and tools to understand antibody sequences.</li></ul><div>
(In passing, I also note that the HIV Vaccine Trials Network has its primary leadership here, and they are very interested in using B cell sequencing to understand vaccine response.)</div>
</div></div></div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities
</b></h2><div><div><div><div>This project is to analyze the antibody immune response in Dr. Overbaugh’s priceless samples from a cohort of Kenyan sex workers in the era before widely-available antiretrovirals. The general goal is to understand the broad and potent antibody responses raised by these women. Our part of that goal will be to perform sequence analysis to understand the events leading to, selective pressures on, and co-evolution of HIV-responsive lineages. This will include close inspection of individual data sets as well as methods development to characterize the antibody response in more detail.</div><br>
<div>
This project will entail be a convergence of the two primary themes in my group: Bayesian phylogenetics and B cell receptor sequence analysis. Our recent work has convinced us that Bayesian methods are needed for antibody ancestral sequence reconstruction, and we’re going all-in. There special challenges, such as context sensitive mutation and strong natural selection, and also special opportunities.</div><br>
<div>
One of the special opportunities that this work provides is that these inferences can be validated by lab work.</div><div><br>
The Overbaugh lab is expert at expressing antibodies and testing their properties, in particular against viruses isolated from these same individuals. This will create a beautiful dynamic feedback loop that we can use to learn about coevolution.</div><div>
In case you aren’t already stoked, here’s an image from Liao et al 2013 showing the epic evolutionary battle between HIV (top) and antibodies (bottom):</div><br>

Our systems are built entirely in-house, and are on the cutting edge in automated large scale supply chain planning and optimization systems. IPC fosters new game-changing ideas, continuously improves, resulting in sophisticated, intelligent and self-learning models.

As a Sr. Product Manager in the IPC team, the individual will be responsible for managing the design, development and roll-out of new products and/or additional features and capabilities in existing products.

</p><p>Socrata set out to develop a new kind of cloud-based software infrastructure and an innovation network designed to unlock the flow of government data.

Senior Software Engineer - Machine Learning Systems,Sift Science,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><b>About the team:</b><br>
Sift’s Machine Learning Infrastructure team is responsible for owning the processes, systems and technologies that make our Machine Learning teams, engineers and data scientists more effective at their jobs. We own some of the hardest scaling, software and systems problems needed to create great Machine Learning. The team owns the systems that create machine-clusters for use with batch processing (a framework for spinning up, populating data, running and tearing down AWS Elastic-Map-Reduce), systems and libraries for modeling the work-flows that allow for offline training and standardizing the intermediate and output artifacts of previous runs. We also own optimizing these runs for speed, parallel processing and computation costs. Input data sets typically run into hundreds of terabytes and workflows take as long as multiple days.
<br><br>
<b>Skills we value in this role:</b><br>
<b>Communication:</b> Your customers are the abuse-products teams that are building Machine Learning models to build trust on the web, so the ability to motivate, teach, listen and empathize with ML engineers and data scientists is required.
<br><br>
Technical Leadership in Large System Design and Implementation: Work on offline data pipelines and online machine learning implementations at scale - thousands of models derived from hundreds of terabytes of data. Implement scalable, low-latency, high throughput, fault-tolerant, extensible, and easily maintainable production systems. The problems we are solving do not have off-the-shelf solutions that will meet the needs of our ML-models and scale, so many aspects of the problems we are solving require new architectures.
<br><br>
<b>Project Management and Leadership:</b> You’ll lead architecture discussions, design reviews, and mentor junior engineers. You will skillfully delegate, get commitments, create schedules, hold teams accountable and escalate as needed to deliver cross team initiatives.
<br><br>
<b>What would make you a strong fit:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Designed and built scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-traffic production services</li>
<li>Have worked on complex systems composed of multiple services</li>
<li>Strong software engineering fundamentals</li>
<li>Strong communication &amp; collaboration skills, and a belief that team output is more important than individual output</li>
<li>Experience building backend systems using Java / Scala / Python</li>
<li>Experience with big data and related systems</li>
</ul>
<b>A little about us:</b><br>
Sift Science is a hyper-growth Series D company that facilitates the largest trust network of online businesses and consumers on the internet.
<br><br>
The Sift Science Trust PlatformTM uses real-time machine learning to accurately predict which users businesses can trust, and which ones they can’t. The upshot? Businesses can customize each user's experience based on their trust score – which leads to more revenue, higher conversion rates, and less fraud and abuse.</span>",2 reviews,"Seattle, WA"

Are you passionate about helping customers learn about products they'd be interested in buying? New dresses from a favorite brand, newly innovated skin care products, high tech office chairs, a movie to watch with friends at home on a Friday night…The list goes on. Amazon's Discovery Innovation team is looking for candidates to join a flexible rapid response team that is growing to meet the demands of a changing business in the age of digital and mobile.<br>
Recommender systems at other companies focus on only one vertical - just movies, just music or just people. At Amazon, we build recommender systems for all product categories - E-Books, Music, Movies, Games, Clothing and Accessories, Electronics, Consumables, Home and Garden and Sports (to name a few). The technical challenges are very different and the data is not static in time – how do you spot the next color favorite for clothing ahead of everyone else? How should algorithms that suggest recommended products on Amazon's gateway page differ from those that target the search page, detail page, shopping cart page and the thank you page. How should we deal with free products? What about frequent buyer programs like Amazon Prime? How should we use Machine Learning to build optimal recommendation systems? How can we exploit the rich structure of Amazon's catalog to build semantic recommendations? How can we optimize our algorithms for tablets, mobile phones, TVs and desktops?<br>
These are all the problems we tackle every day. If you think you have answers to these questions and many others that aren't included here, then we want to talk to you. If you have deep experience in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Collaborative Filtering or Search, know how to deliver, are highly innovative and want to build systems that contribute immensely to the company's bottom line, then we want to talk to you.<br>

The position requires working closely with engineering and science teams, product teams, and marketing teams across Amazon on product development, business requirements, and long term profit optimization.<br>
A successful candidate will anticipate and make tradeoffs, balance the business needs versus technical constraints, and encourage risk-taking behavior to maximize business benefit.

Support priority efforts as identified by Consortium partners (e.g., Immunotherapy)</li></ul><div><br>
<b>
KNOWLEDGE OF THE RESEARCH PRACTICES &amp; OPERATIONS</b></div><ul><li>
This includes in-depth understanding of the way scientists must work to fund and support key research projects, the stages of proposals and approvals, and the funding and regulatory environment in general, as well as the operational requirements of providing clinical-based support. The incumbent must possess skills in establishing and communicating the defining structures, systems, decision and approval points and the process of research trial protocols. The Director is effective in developing and gaining support for research priorities, understanding the limits of support (such as financial support or staff availability), and the best options for carrying out various research projects within the context of an integrated network of host sites. The Director must embrace change, skillfully communicate and ensure human research participant protections as a balanced part of research support. Knowledge of the underpinnings of scientific methodology and the sciences (in virtually any domain) is highly desirable.</li></ul><div><br>
<b>
INTEGRATION OF CLINICAL &amp; RESEARCH CARE</b></div><ul><li>
A key part of the Director’s role is fostering the integration of clinical and research care as more than a set of systems and protocols, but as a mindset embedded in the SCCA culture. For the Director this requires a specific, technical knowledge base, including a thorough understanding of the similarities and differences between clinical care and research care. This includes an ability to understand and incorporate emerging, cutting edge trends and best practices in clinical research and oncology care (e.g., implementation of personalized therapies in clinical trials). Finally, given the nature of the Consortium and networked research/care sites, the Director must understand the differences inherent in community and academic hospital settings.</li></ul><p>
Based on this understanding, the Director is expected to skillfully articulate and advocate for the ways clinical and research care can be tied together as acritical part of SCCA’s mission. More than any other SCCA leader, the Director is expected to ‘live’ the integration of clinical and research care in all decisions and actions, and to stand out as a guiding voice in promoting that integration throughout the organization.</p><div><br>
<b>
LEADERSHIP VISION &amp; ACTION</b></div><ul><li>
Leadership for this position begins with being able to articulate a strong, inspiring vision for SCCA’s integrated research programs, and then building a team that can turn that vision into reality. The Director must be willing to welcome and encourage feedback from a broad community of constituents with the ultimate goal of making SCCA increasingly viable as a research host. But more than this, the Director sees the job as being a catalyst to breakthroughs in how research is supported and managed; not just reactive to feedback or changes in the industry, but as a strategic leader who is willing to take reasonable risks in guiding visionary operational and cultural change. From this standpoint, the Director’s role is that of an action-oriented problem-solver and “entrepreneur” who deeply values creativity, the ability to keep an open mind, and the capacity to envision, challenge and inspire without regard to existing structures or the status quo.</li></ul><div><br>
<b>
METRIC ORIENTATION &amp; OUTCOME MINDSET</b></div><ul><li>
The Director is fluent in applying data-based approaches to supporting and managing trials. This mindset is needed to not only understand the nature of studies and the scientific/statistical foundations of the trials themselves, but from a management standpoint it is also critical to monitoring the entire system and flow of studies through the organization. A “metric orientation” includes a personal commitment to using quantitative measurements to foster accountability and evaluate change in a complex environment; for example by applying Lean methods and principles to continuously improving the performance of organizational systems that support research.</li></ul><div><br>
<b>
MANAGEMENT SKILLS</b></div><ul><li>
As a line manager of others’ work, the Director must be able to lead a team to accomplish operational priorities. This demands a strong capacity for personal and organizational discipline, effectively applying traditional management skills such as time management, delegation and workload control, planning and goal-setting, communication (both oral and written skills, including presentations), and monitoring of progress toward desired results. These skills also include those specifically used to help guide, direct and support others, including skills in coaching, mentoring, placement of staff, professional development (for both self and others), performance evaluation, and when needed, corrective action and termination - with the ultimate goal of sustaining positive morale and high productivity within the groups managed. The Director is expected to use a situational management style, applying more or less directive approaches with people as circumstances and their performance dictates.</li></ul><div><br>
<b>
INFLUENCING SKILLS</b></div><ul><li>
As part of the Consortium, SCCA is part of a highly complex organizational system. Leading as the Director is more than just holding a clear and inspiring vision or advocating for research integration. In order to carry out the demands of the position and lead change, the Director must be a skilled player in a culture that requires by turns negotiation, diplomacy and facilitation, where one’s impact is defined far more by personal influence and credibility than by the formal authority of the role. The Director must be sensitive to the everyday politics of this world and be comfortable working with them. This includes refined interpersonal skills, including patience, flexibility, stamina and resilience, the ability to listen in humble enquiry and empathy, the capacity to work through tensions and conflicts and to enact compromises, and also to know how and when to exercise an assertive, no-nonsense stand and set firm limits that protect the organization’s interests. The Director must have the breadth of skill and confidence to be able to work with anyone, at any level, from front-line and professional staff to principal investigators and executives.</li></ul><div><br>
<b>
TEAM DEVELOPMENT SKILLS</b></div><ul><li>
Beginning with his or her own functional workgroup, the Director is expected to have skills in building a strong sense of team, helping people align with a clear purpose and build collaborative, partnership relationships with one another. The Director actively promotes a respectful, inclusive and trust-based work environment, one that enables people to do their best work. The Director models these skills and values personally as team leader, ably (and sometimes courageously) stepping into awkward or tense situations in order to foster mutual wins and bring people together. The Director is also expected to bring these same skills and values as a part of the work to build broader teams across all types of organizational lines and levels, with peers and senior leaders, as well. In this regard the Director is not just expected to serve as a functional leader but also to serve as an overall SCCA leader, garnering the respect of colleagues throughout the system, including the highest levels of the Consortium.</li></ul>

Sr. Product Designer,ChefSteps,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary"">As a key member of our design team, the product designer will work on one of ChefSteps’s core products. Our designers work to solve difficult problems for people and, at the same time, to create culture—which is really the amazing part about working here. We strive not just to make cooking easier, but also to persuade people to place greater value on the time they spend cooking so that they will do it more often.
<br><br>
WHAT YOU’LL DO
<br>We are looking for a designer who is relentless—not just about beautiful design, but about creating a seamless user experience as well. The right candidate will have a genuine passion for digital product design, and applicants should demonstrate experience building scalable systems rather than one-off solutions. Also essential: the ability to analyze customer behavior to ensure that the product experience is simple, seamless, sticky, and always enjoyable. Bonus points to those who are savvy with AngularJS, React Native, and HTML/CSS.
<br><br>
PORTFOLIO WORK
<br>When it comes to experience building and shipping products, we’re looking for designers with both depth and breadth. Depth is critical for understanding ownership and how much work you put into an end-to-end experience. We want evidence that you have both thought about a product as a whole and considered all the disparate and complex pieces that go into it—and brought the whole and the parts together harmoniously. We want a designer who can focus on designing systems as much as the UI, with product thinking that is mature and complementary to the visual and UX design. Because product designers at ChefSteps also help manage product development—we don’t have pure product managers here—we need folks who show strength in both areas. Put simply: You should feel ready to rally a team made up of people from around the company to help bring the product vision to reality.
<br><br>
WHAT WILL HELP YOU BE MOST SUCCESSFUL
<br><ul>
<li>Well-rounded UX skills with a clear history of shipping cohesive products</li>
<li>A collaborative, empathetic, and iterative design process with an emphasis on end users and problem-solving for poor or underserved markets</li>
<li>Experience working with researchers and data scientists to set up, optimize, and analyze experiments</li>
<li>Visual design skills that demonstrate expertise in brand identity, typography, and color theory</li>
<li>Experience building interactive prototypes</li>
<li>Deep knowledge of designing ecosystems, rather than one-off solutions</li>
<li>A demonstrated understanding of the areas that design supports—namely, sales and product management</li>
<li>Ability to turn projects into products, demonstrating ownership of the process from start to finish—including planning product features and determining when to ship</li>
<li>Humility, intelligence, efficiency</li>
<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li>
<li>Facility with whiteboarding, sketching, and iterating</li>
</ul>
ICING-ON-THE-CAKE EXPERIENCE
<br><ul>
<li>Ability to prototype or build in HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
<li>Product management experience</li>
<li>Usability or UX research skills</li>
<li>Marketing/advertising/branding expertise</li>
</ul>
PERKS OF THE JOB
<br><ul>
<li>Full health coverage, plus vision and dental insurance</li>
<li>Competitive pay, annual salary adjustments, 401(k) plan, and ownership in the form of shares and/or options</li>
<li>Self-determined leave—you schedule your own vacation and sick days, coordinating directly with your teammates</li>
<li>Enriching work environment: Whether you want to master chocolate soufflé, score pro photography tips, master new math skills, or learn to pilot a glider, your ChefSteps teammates can help you. We hire fascinating people from many different backgrounds—Michelin-star chefs, award-winning animators and designers, top engineers, and globe-trotting journalists. If you come to work looking to get smarter, you’ve come to the right place.</li>
<li>Design your own workstation—we encourage employees to request the tools and supplies they need to do their job well</li>
<li>Dog-friendly work environment</li>
<li>Seriously stocked coffee station: La Marzocco espresso maker, pour overs, French presses—we provide you with all of them, plus Herkimer beans for days. Just want a Nespresso? We’ve got that too.</li>
<li>So much free food—snacks to fuel you, dishes crafted by ridiculously talented chefs to feed your very soul. Seriously, it’s like working in a secret Seattle restaurant that also happens to be the best one.</li>
<li>The best parties, sailing trips, mountain vacations, and more—many of us have a background in hospitality, and we like to do it up right</li>
<li>Great location. First: We work in downtown Seattle which, wow. This city is amazing. Second, we are right in the heart of Pike Place Market, which means drinking, eating, and grocery shopping in a world-class food destination mere steps from your desk. What, pray tell, could be better than that?</li>

Senior Manager for Automated Profitability Management,Amazon.com,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Job Description
</b></h2><div><div><div>The vision of Automated Profitability Management (APM) is to automate and improve Amazon Retail Profitability through the innovative application of Machine Learning and Software Engineering.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, this involved an Amazon retail business person picking up the phone, calling up their counter-part on the supplier side to discuss and improve the terms of doing business with Amazon. These terms include: what is the price Amazon should pay to the vendor for a given unit of a product? Can we get vendor to provide funding for initiatives on Amazon (e.g. volume-based incentives, promotions / merchandising opportunities on our website)? How do we handle the cost of bringing in the product / cover any damage to the products? Do we have alternative sourcing channels (e.g. two or more vendors offering the same product) so we can negotiate harder? Each of these negotiation decisions has a direct impact on Amazon’s profitability.<br>
<br>
Now imagine doing this across tens of thousands of suppliers and tens of millions of products, across tens of different countries worldwide, and at a double-digit growth rate every year. Clearly it is not a problem we can solve with humans because we won’t be able to scale. Instead of relying on humans to make the final call, we will have machines make the actual decisions, so it is completely ‘hands off the wheels’ from humans.<br>
<br>
How do we do that? The good thing is we have data. Tons of them – historical contracts, product costs and historical supplier funding, sales performance etc. We will leverage this advantage to solve the problem using algorithms, machine learning and data-driven approaches. Hence we are turning the art of Retail profitability management into a science. At Automated Profitability Systems, we are developing systems that will use technology to disrupt and fundamentally change the way e-commerce costs and supplier terms are managed.<br>
<br>
We are looking for a person who can think big and be a change driver. You are strong at communicating your plans to the Retail leadership and influencing them. As a leader of this organization, you will manage several disciplines including Software Development, User Experience, Program Management, Research and Data Scientists.<br>

Software Development Engineer - Advertising Platform,Amazon.com,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Job Description
</b></h2><div><div><div>JOB DESCRIPTION<br>
Amazon's Advertising Platform is positioned to grow its share of the online advertising industry due to its unique combination of online retail behavior data, industry-leading cloud services, and a fast-moving startup culture. The targeting platform enables our ad systems to deliver the right ads to the right users. To accomplish this goal, we are applying the latest low latency, big data technologies and toolsets which allow us to understand our users interests and personalize their experiences.<br>
<br>
About you:<br>
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack - from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.<br>
<br>
Some problem spaces we'll be working on:<br>
<br>
TARGETING - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. This data can be used to help us decide what else they are likely to be interested in and to respond to. Accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. . You will be working with other driven engineers to deliver our features and solutions. This will require core engineering and programming skills, insight, technical capability, data driven decision making, creativity and an obsession to ship high quality solutions for our customers.<br>
<br>
MACHINE LEARNING &amp; ANALYTICS - there's an almost overwhelming amount of data available, and we need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict any measurable signal. You will be working in the designing, building and finally shipping these products together with partners, product management, other engineers and data scientists.<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER FACING TOOLS - all our processes are driven through a toolset that we have built. You will establish the roadmap for our customer facing functionalities, ensure prioritization and ultimately build these features. Shipping a high quality toolset always requires being data driven and having strong engineering skills. You need to be obsessed with ensuring the best end to end experience for our customers.<br>

<br><br>
<b>Process:</b> We’re always looking for ways to work better together, and to develop processes that support stable and reliable systems.

<b>What you’ll do:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Lead a team of talented engineers and data scientists to deliver Sift’s Account Take Over product</li>
<li>Champion best practices for running highly performant systems end-to-end: from design, to implementation, to testing, to deployment and ongoing operation</li>

Zillow Group's Consumer Analytics team helps tackle problems and derive insights for organizations across the company. Each team member focuses on a cross-section of the Zillow Group community. Our team structure is very flat. You will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership (probably even Spencer). You'll work with them to make important, strategic decisions influencing the future of the company.<br>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About the role</b></h2><p>
Zillow is currently seeking a Data Science Manager to lead user engagement efforts within Zillow's Consumer Analytics Team.

You'll help guide their efforts while also providing valuable insights as an individual contributor yourself.<br>
Once you're here, you and the data scientists you lead will primarily support Zillow's product efforts which we've grouped into activation, re-engagement, and shopping. You'll support these efforts by organizing, analyzing, and reporting on data describing how consumers (that's people coming to our site and apps in search of the perfect home) interact with our products throughout the their home-shopping journeys. The overarching objectives of this role are to collaborate with others in our Product Development and Business organizations to assess the effectiveness of our shopping-related products and to find opportunities to improve them in the future.

Work with leaders in product, marketing, design, and analytics to compile robust data sets describing Zillow's user engagement efforts to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives and to identify and size opportunities for new initiatives.</li><li>
Dive into Zillow's internal data (think Hive, Presto, SQL Server, Redshift, Python, Mode Analytics, Tableau, R) to develop tools that monitor important metrics, conduct segmentation and pathing analyses, analyze AB test results, and build forecasts for user engagement.</li><li>
Evaluate and summarize the performance of user engagement across all of Zillow's products in weekly, monthly, and quarterly meetings to keep existing efforts on track, measure progress toward goals, and identify areas for improvement.</li></ul><br>

More specifically:</p><ul><li>
You have an Undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. science, engineering, economics, statistics).</li><li>
You have 5-7 years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and complex problem solving (preferably related to consumer-facing internet products).</li><li>
You have 2-4 years of people management experience.</li><li>
You have foundational analytical skills (e.g., total command of Excel and SQL, experience using R and/or Python) and are a Tableau pro.</li><li>
You are comfortable talking about methods used in content personalization, feature testing, and feature development, and can turn analytical results into actionable strategies.</li><li>
You have worked with gigantic data sets and are comfortable accessing those data (even if they're in JSON) with Hive and Presto.</li><li>
You can cobble together insights from raw Google Analytics data in your sleep and would be comfortable aligning those clickstream with raw data ingested directly from our own products to derive insights that positively influence the business.</li><li>
You understand concepts, terminology, and measurement issues related to web/app analytics and user research in terms of user activation, retention, and engagement.</li><li>
You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and work well on teams of all sizes with representatives from a diverse set of technical backgrounds.</li><li>

<p>This role will be part of our data engineering group that works closely with our feature product teams facilitating the underlying data model and architecture as our product evolves. Knowledge and experience within systems and software architecture is required.</p>
<p>Porch’s tech stack has evolved around Microservices Architecture and underlying micro-databases. We integrate the application of DDL and DML into our software CI systems via Flyway so that our services have true ownership of our data.

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities:</b></h2>
<p>The Architecture Stuff:</p>
<ul><li><p>Data Architecture - You will need to ensure we have the correct level of normalization to support that application features. Maintain the integrity of the underlying data, ensure we have a transactionally consistent view of the data when necessary and support eventually consistent data representations when appropriate.</p>
</li><li><p>Domain Modeling - Is A a part of B or a part of C or is A actually D? Sometimes microservices get scope creep, it is generally most apparent and least reversible at the data layer. Be comfortable asking questions and giving frank answers.</p>
</li><li><p>OLTP vs. OLAP - Is the request a functional requirement of the application or a reporting need? Keep analytical requirements out of transactional systems and evangelize the usage of the data warehouse. Be the bridge between the Engineering, Product, and Development (EPD) teams and the Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Warehouse.</p>
</li></ul><p>The Engineering Stuff: You will work with several software engineering teams to ensure the application is supported by a high quality data layer. This means you need to own:</p>
<ul><li><p>Data Migrations - Underlying data model changes? New features? Migration plans may be needed to support the evolution of the systems while maximizing availability.</p>
</li><li><p>Technologies - Not everything has to be in a relational database. Be open to leveraging key-value stores, document databases, and other technologies to provide the right tool for the job.</p>
</li><li><p>Process Improvement - Is there a better way? Periodically question what, how and why you are doing a task. Don’t be a drone.</p>
</li><li><p>Collaboration - Vertically: fulfill the needs of the application layer and front end. Horizontally: communicate and coordinate with data engineering team to establish conventions, utilize best practices and share lessons learned.</p>
</li><li><p>Scaling - Identify appropriate applications of partitioning and sharding.</p>
</li></ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Experience:</b></h2>

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington focused on expanding the quantitative evidence base for health. A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) enterprise. A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The forecasting project forecasts GBD inputs and results (burden of more than 300 diseases and injuries and more than 80 risk factors for all GBD geographic locations) to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality future estimates to make decisions that improve health.
<br>
<br>
<b>IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Statistical Modeler on the Future Health Scenarios team</b>. The Future Health Scenarios team uses data from the GBD enterprise to generate long-term population health forecasts and alternative scenarios for several hundreds of locations worldwide. The forecasting model incorporates known relationships between sociodemographic indicators, risk factors, and causes of death to generate estimates for life expectancy, mortality, and disability that are age- and sex-specific.
<br>
<br>
The Statistical Modeler will utilize advanced quantitative modeling techniques to generate a variety of location-specific, cause-specific, and bespoke health scenarios. The Statistical Modeler will work closely with team faculty, researchers, data specialists, project officers and analysts to build alternative health scenario models, and produce, vet, and disseminate results.

<br><br>
We are looking for an analytically-oriented Research Analyst to join our firm and assist our client service teams in consulting engagements with leading companies.
<br><br>
About Schireson
<br><br>
Schireson is a data-driven strategy consulting firm with offices in New York, Seattle, Boston, and Austin. We deliver custom strategies and solutions for our clients using a combination of data science, advanced research, and business-savvy imagination. We always aim to do superb work, and we always try to make the experience of working with us delightful. We also try to have fun while we’re doing it.
<br><br>
Our clients are market leaders from a wide range of industries, including media &amp; entertainment, technology, professional services, non-profit, financial services, and automotive, among other categories. We forge deep, on-going relationships with our clients, and in return they trust us to help them navigate their most complex business challenges.
<br><br>
We come from many different academic backgrounds and schools, from BA’s to advanced degrees. Many of us have professional roots in tech and marketing, and our collective previous experience spans music, design, entrepreneurship, market research, venture capital, investment banking, management consulting, and even YouTube sketch comedy.
<br><br>
About the Research Analyst Role
<br><br>
As a Research Analyst, you would be part of a team working on client consulting projects. You would support Consultants, Managers and other senior staff members throughout client engagements and help ensure that they have an amazing experience in working with us.
<br><br>
<b>Your responsibilities would include:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Help manage research projects through the entire lifecycle – survey design, managing outside vendors, data analysis, and presentations.</li>
<li>Write and edit survey documents.</li>
<li>Manage vendors involved in survey data collection.</li>
<li>Perform data analysis in Excel and other statistical packages to identify key insights in the data.</li>
<li>Design and build presentations for clients.</li>
<li>Support senior staff members in work sessions and presentations with clients.</li>
<li>Help create interactive data tools that are delivered to clients, such as market simulation tools built in Microsoft Excel or other platforms – you would be provided training in how to create these, but prior experience with tools like Excel is a plus.</li>
</ul>
<b>The ideal candidate will have:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>A degree (or working towards a degree) in a field related to business, information systems, social science, or design/engineering. A quantitatively-oriented major or course work is preferred.</li>
<li>Coursework and/or experience in marketing is preferred.</li>
<li>Some background in statistics.</li>
<li>Proficiency in Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint).</li>
<li>Superb communication and presentation skills.</li>
<li>Ability to think strategically, analytically, and proactively about diverse business problems.</li>
<li>Passion for managing the quality &amp; accuracy of research instruments (e.g. surveys) and analytics, including checking your and others’ work.</li>
<li>Experience multi-tasking in a fast-paced – and fast-growing – small company or professional services/consulting firm environment is a plus (but not required)</li>
<li>Experience in a statistical package like SPSS, SAS, Q, or experience in R and Python are a plus (but not required)</li>
</ul>
What’s important to us (and, ideally, to you)
<br><br>
<b>Quality:</b> On the get it right versus get it done scale, we skew more towards “get it right.” But keep in mind that when the most valuable companies in the world are your clients, you will be expected to deliver high quality insights under time constraints.
<br><br>
<b>Curiosity and Intellectual Chops:</b> People at Schireson are smart and intellectually curious across the map, from learning about new music, to where to find the best tacos, to how to visualize data in new ways using R. We like learning new techniques and would love for you to teach us some new tricks. And by the way, it’s OK if you don’t know everything there is to know about R, Python or SPSS.
<br><br>
<b>Personality:</b> This isn’t a typical “corporate” environment - our offices are very casual and we give our employees virtually unlimited flexibility in scheduling their work. But you should be able to handle that and thrive with the freedom. We respect and appreciate the unique and interesting extra- circular activities you might have outside of work. We value the diverse and dynamic people that make up our team, and look forward to working with similar type people.
<br><br>
<b>Life/Work Balance:</b> We pride ourselves on benefits such as unlimited vacation days, productivity bonuses, vacation bonuses, excellent health care and truly amazing company retreats. This is all to say that we think happy people both inside and outside work, make better employees. We ask that you work hard and kill it at your job; we’ll be happy to make your life a little less stressful and more fun.</span>",,"Seattle, WA"

Statistical Modeler,Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation - Faculty,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington focused on expanding the quantitative evidence base for health. A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) enterprise. A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The forecasting project forecasts GBD inputs and results (burden of more than 300 diseases and injuries and more than 80 risk factors for all GBD geographic locations) to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality future estimates to make decisions that improve health.</p>
<p>
IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Statistical Modeler on the Future Health Scenarios team. The Future Health Scenarios team uses data from the GBD enterprise to generate long-term population health forecasts and alternative scenarios for several hundreds of locations worldwide. The forecasting model incorporates known relationships between sociodemographic indicators, risk factors, and causes of death to generate estimates for life expectancy, mortality, and disability that are age- and sex-specific.</p>
<p>
The Statistical Modeler will utilize advanced quantitative modeling techniques to generate a variety of location-specific, cause-specific, and bespoke health scenarios. The Statistical Modeler will work closely with team faculty, researchers, data specialists, project officers and analysts to build alternative health scenario models, and produce, vet, and disseminate results.</p>
<p>
Overall, the Statistical Modeler will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic team. This position is contingent on project funding availability.</p>

<p><i>
Research command and analyses</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Carry out quantitative analyses and participate in collaborative research projects.</li>
<li>Undertake innovative applied research and application of Bayesian statistical techniques to novel analytic challenges. In this case, the focus is on forecasting and generating alternative scenarios by writing and executing code to model the impact of different variable factors on a range of health indicators over time. The primary subject of such forecasts and scenarios are forecasts of fatal and nonfatal health outcomes as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise. Variable drivers could include risk factors, interventions, and socioeconomic and health system factors.</li>
<li>Develop new code, modify existing code, and implement computational and statistical methods. Create, test, and use relevant computer code (Python, R, Java, C, or C++). Maintain and distribute completed software.</li>
<li>Develop new methods to define the etiology of diseases, including diarrhea, lower respiratory illness, and severe fevers, and predict what portion of these diseases is attributable to underlying sub-causes.</li>
<li>Review and assess data sources in order to determine their relevance and utility for ongoing analyses. Become an expert in understanding key data sources and, in particular, variations in these across and within countries. Data might include results on deaths, causes of death, nonfatal health outcomes, risk factors, population, education, a range of interventions, and related variables.</li>
<li>Assess the quality of various data sources available and develop methods to correct limitations or biases where needed.</li>
<li>Communicate with external collaborators in order to best understand the nature, key characteristics, and context of the data; engage in critiques of the analytic results; and disseminate findings.</li>
<li>Develop and maintain relationships with designated collaborators. Respond to and, as appropriate, integrate feedback from collaborators into the analyses. Work directly with collaborators to facilitate their understanding of data to which they have access, and in turn help them understand the methods being applied. Help to manage and orchestrate joint strategies for analysis.</li>
<li>Assess and coordinate with others on the integration of analytic methods into computational machinery. Work with evolving databases so that the results can be: 1) produced as part of an overall system supporting the forecasting analyses portfolio, and 2) used in conjunction with results from other research streams at IHME.</li>
<li>Be an effective communicator with other project staff of varying levels, disciplines, and authority to achieve team goals for the analyses and related outputs.</li>
<li>Contribute and develop ideas for new research projects.</li>
</ul><p><i>Publication and dissemination</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute as needed to the publication of research methods and results in peer-reviewed journals, including generating results, contributing to writing, and preparing responses to critiques.</li>

"Experience Management Scientist, Employee Experience",Qualtrics,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary"">**************
<br>Why Qualtrics?
<br>**************
<br><br>
At Qualtrics, our mission is to close experience gaps—the costly differences between what customers and employees expect, and what they’re receiving.
<br><br>
9,000+ organizations worldwide and more than 80% of the Fortune 100 rely on the Qualtrics Experience Management Platform™ to collect, analyze, and act on feedback—more feedback than they ever thought possible. With Qualtrics XM, organizations can handle the four core experiences of business—customer, employee, product, and brand experience. Organizations can be at every meaningful touchpoint, for every experience, and predict what will resonate most with customers and employees.
<br><br>
Employee Experience (or EX) is a major pillar of our business. Through our suite of listening tools, organizations are able to build ecosystems of employee feedback, from pre-hire to exit. Integrations and automation mean this can be done with minimal ongoing workload. While our platform is purpose-built to deliver the traditional annual engagement, we are helping organizations evolve their feedback programs to feel more fresh, agile and aligned with their business imperatives.
<br><br>
--------------
<br>About the Team
<br>--------------
<br><br>
Qualtrics is in the business of helping organizations manage experiences. Of all experiences an organization delivers, employee experiences have a lasting impact on talent retention, productivity, and the overall bottom-line of the organization. However, many of the world's organizations have followed a very outdated approach to understanding their employees.
<br><br>
As the employee landscape shifts, these outdated approaches are not delivering the insights required to truly engage their employee base. As such, these organizations are also looking for a new way to not just monitor, but understand and improve the experiences they deliver to their employees. Qualtrics has provided a new approach built on a foundation of elite technology and solid expertise that is getting results for many of the world's top organizations.

<br><br>
You will have a keen understanding of client needs in the world of employee feedback programs. You will have experience of designing large-scale employee feedback programs within global organizations and be able to communicate industry trends at senior levels within their customers.

You will influence our customers and help them design and shape their programs for the future, to organizations that are both mature and immature in the employee survey space. You will understand the significant industry shifts taking place in employee surveys, and be able to design visionary, creative yet impactful solutions to clients.
<br><br>
You are a strong presenter who represents Qualtrics at industry events and evangelizing the work we do with customers.
<br><br>
Finally, you are passionate about and believe in our culture and values. They’ll believe in work being a positive experience for themselves and their co-workers, and be willing to strap in and enjoy the ride!
<br><br>

<br>Responsibilities
<br>----------------

Director of Data Acquisition,Textio,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary"">We believe that the future of writing is knowing who will respond to anything you write before you even publish it. Textio’s category-defining augmented writing platform is delighting customers, and we’re looking for a Director of Data Acquisition with a strong sense of ownership to join our Seattle team.
<br><br>
At their core, Textio’s linguistic data sets are real-world documents paired with their real-world performance outcomes. As Textio’s augmented writing platform extends to more and more kinds of writing, these linguistic data sets are the foundation on which our entire platform and user experience are based. Whether Textio’s platform is being applied to job posts, emails, or any other kind of writing, it all starts with the data.
<br><br>
In this role, you will build linguistic data sets from the ground up using whatever techniques are required. You will work with our customers to collect data where appropriate. You will design and run crowdsourcing experiments to build labeled data sets and will take advantage of publicly available data sources where it makes sense. You are scrappy and you see labeled data sets where other people don’t even think to look.
<br><br>
Our Director of Data Acquisition knows how to turn these labeled data sets into testable hypotheses. If you can look at a piece of writing and immediately understand which linguistic variables are likely to influence its performance, then you can work with ML and NLP engineers to test your hypotheses against the data sets you have assembled.
<br><br>
Finally, you will turn Textio’s models into writing guidance that real people can use. Textio writers are not linguists, statisticians, or data scientists. We can’t assume they are familiar with linguistic concepts. The Director of Data Acquisition will translate predictive models into real writing guidance—and come up with clever ways to automate this process along the way.
<br><br>
<b>We’d love to hear from you if:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>You have a strong background in empirical linguistics, experimental design, and/or user experience</li>
<li>You have previously shipped production software that real people have used</li>
<li>You have experience building text corpora from the ground up, including use of crowdsourcing platforms to build tagged data sets</li>
<li>You are not a theoretical purist, and understand that the best product experiences come from blending approaches in machine learning, NLP, and linguistics</li>
<li>You are comfortable working closely with data and infrastructure engineers, but you speak better human than machine</li>
<li>You know how to ship a project on schedule, and you have a deep desire to own and lead</li>
<li>You’re at ease writing scripts (in R, Python, or similar) and SQL to bring value out of data</li>
<li>You are an excellent communicator verbally and in writing—Textio stands for editorial quality, and you do too</li>
<li>You’re committed to quality as a top priority—you pay attention to what you make, and take pride in it</li>
<li>You have a track record of experimenting, building, and learning new things</li>
<li>You have a point of view but are low ego</li>
</ul>
This is a leadership role on our growing Product team.
<br><br>
We’re not looking for ninjas or rock stars. We want an awesome and trustworthy Director of Data Acquisition to lead our most critical language experience work from design all the way through implementation.
<br><br>
Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. If there is anything we can do to create a more comfortable interview experience for you, please let us know.
