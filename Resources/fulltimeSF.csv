Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.
<br><br>
Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.
<br><br>
States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.
<br><br>
*************************************************
<br>We're growing our data science team at all levels

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun, diverse, and respectful corporate atmosphere.

Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.
<br><br>
We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

<li>Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models</li>
<li>Strengths aligned with our needs</li>
<li>Theoretical background relevant to data science (e.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?)</li>
<li>Technical skills (e.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?)</li>
<li>Creative skills (e.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?)</li>
<li>Collaboration skills (e.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?)</li>

<br>
Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to create and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.
<br>
Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Lightroom CC, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.
<br>
We are building new machine learning platform, called Adobe Sensei, that powers machine learning and AI across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform will enable thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!
<br>
A crucial piece of developing machine learning solutions is the evaluation process. How do we know the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use for judging them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?
<br>
How can you participate? We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of both A/B tests and human-judgment tasks to arrive at quantitative evaluations that measure how well our AI/ML algorithms are doing their jobs.
<br>
Responsibilities:
<br>
<ul><li>Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success
</li><li>Design evaluation tasks and guidelines for human judgment to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
</li><li>Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
</li><li>Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
</li></ul>Qualifications:
<br>
<ul><li>BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a huna-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
</li><li>Exposure to applied machine learning in an industrial setting
</li><li>Experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models
</li><li>Strong quantitative orientation
</li><li>Understanding of issues around ground truth and training sets for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
</li><li>Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Crowdflower, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk
</li></ul>At Adobe, you will be immersed in an exceptional work environment that is recognized throughout the world on Best Companies lists. You will also be surrounded by colleagues who are committed to helping each other grow through our unique Check-In approach where ongoing feedback flows freely. If you’re looking to make an impact, Adobe's the place for you. Discover what our employees are saying about their career experiences on the Adobe Life blog and explore the meaningful benefits we offer.

"Lead Product Manager, Data (multiple positions)",Credit Karma,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><div><div>The product management team at Credit Karma is the driving force to expanding our service beyond credit and enabling our members to make progress across their entire financial life. Credit Karma is quickly becoming the “money button on the phone” for our 80M+ members, enabling enormous opportunities to innovate at scale. Many of our team previously worked at startups or scaled environments, but joined to innovate at scale. Credit Karma provides the rare chance to work in a small team and environment while having massive impact to our members.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
Our team has doubled in size in the past 18 months and continues to grow rapidly. As with most product management positions, we expect you to have strong analytical or engineering skills, communicate exceptionally well, find joy in organizing complexity and obsoleting chaos, and have a teaching and learning mindset.</div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>However, unlike product management at other companies, our team is different in a few key ways:</b></h3><div><ul><li>
To get the next level for the company and for our product, we need to deliver on powerful innovations. We fully expect the product to look dramatically different in the coming years than it does today, expanding from a good product into a bigger and better one. Entrepreneurs are welcome, and many of our product team were former founders and CEOs. Additionally, we also require the ability to succeed at scale. We are building many projects in parallel, and you will have constraints and challenges that exist in a larger, more complicated company.
</li><li>Many of our successful PMs do not have engineering or software degrees. We find that grit matched with analytical, business and domain experience are just as critical, and we evaluate each skill and match it with an appropriate role.
</li><li>We recruit generalists since they thrive in a growth environment. Most of our PMs work on more than one initiative in their first year, and almost certainly within their second. Prepare to be challenged and work on projects that range from immature pre-product fit to larger, market leading initiatives.
</li><li>Product management is a discipline of mastering responsibility often without authority. This skill matters even more in a large growth company and we’ve found this is often connected with a person’s soft skills or emotional intelligence (EQ). We screen for high EQ and coach how to improve this, as it’s quite connected to our culture and what sets our team apart from the industry.</li><li>
One of our fundamental beliefs is that diversity delivers a better set of products and outcomes for our consumers and business. As such, we seek to create safe environments so that each employee can be their best self and do their best work. The product management team is the foundation for this value and it leads to the broadest, most diverse and joyful exchange of ideas and innovations. PMs who are used to being the loudest voice in the room winning or creating conflicts to find a path forward struggle to succeed in our team.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Team Structure
</b></h3><div><ul><li>We divide our team into three levels: individual contributors (ICs), leads, and executives. Our ICs titles are Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, and Senior Product Manager. These ICs are experts at shipping software with increasing scope and complexity. Even at these levels, given the hypergrowth we are experiencing, these PMs own the crafting and execution of features or sections of the product. Their core skills include excellence in partnership, communication, distilling requirements, and prioritization with cross-functional teams.</li><li>
Our lead titles are Staff Product Manager, Associate Director, and Director. Leads are responsible for one or more product areas in the product, often managing small teams or creating new products and roadmaps from the beginning. This requires mastery of working in a scaled environment and solving consumer and financial partner opportunities and constraints. Successful leads have worked at scale previously, delivered on successful products in their past, have excellent core product management skills, and can innovate.</li><li>
Management experience is desirable but not required. We do expect this level to mentor other PMs and teams across the whole company. Our leads typically do not manage large hierarchical teams, instead favoring small, swift moving cross-functional pods that are as self-contained as possible. If you like innovating at scale in a hands-on builder environment, a senior product management position might be for you.</li><li>
Lastly, our executive titles are Senior Director and Vice President. PM executives own a business area or a complete product line, often managing a set of leads. This level not only has the responsibility to build out their product area but also partner with other senior leaders across the company to shape the culture and future direction of our company.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Openings</b></h3><div><ul><li>
Our PM team has nearly a dozen roles open, spanning all levels and groups. These include our core initiatives (Credit, ID Protection, Growth &amp; Engagement services), business verticals (Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Mortgage, and Autos), emerging initiatives (Tax and International) and our Data and Monetization platforms. There is no shortage of opportunities to make an impact at all levels.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Data</b></h3><div><ul><li>
The data team leads the charter to develop recommendation and personalization capabilities for our site, email and push notifications, and our ads. As a data product manager you will have a cross-functional role in creating the technology stack that marries high quality user experiences and advertiser value. Whether you're working with our data scientists to develop our next generation of algorithms, figuring out how to improve analytics using machine learning or reimagining visualization and data sharing with new tools, you'll have the opportunity to help us build better products and help our members make meaningful financial progress.

Clinical Laboratory Accessioner,uBiome,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary"">uBiome is a great place to work.
<br>--------------------------------
<br><br>
uBiome’s mission is to transform information about the microbiome into useful products and services that improve people’s lives.
<br><br>
In this job, you’ll be a vital part of our Lab Operations Dream Team, working closely with Clinical Laboratory Scientists and Technicians, as well as our Customer Operations team. Our Accessioner is the Doyen of Data-- all patient information is complete and accurate due to your diligence, and all the data is entered into our LIMS.
<br><br>
You will...
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Comply with HIPAA and PHI practices</li>
<li>Ensure that working practice within the laboratory is in line with Company Health and Safety regulations</li>
<li>Perform data entry using semi-automated methods</li>
<li>Adhere to correct procedures, policies and health/safety guidelines</li>
<li>Keep abreast of all industry developments and best practices</li>
<li>Document all activities appropriately and accurately</li>
<li>Maintain work area and equipment</li>
<li>Collaborate with the Clinical Laboratory teams</li>
<li>Have many opportunities for growth, including gaining peripheral knowledge from working cross-functionally throughout the company</li>
</ul>
You thrive off the adrenaline that comes with busy periods, and use the peace of quieter times to think about how to best optimize your throne in the lab. Of course, you have a B.A. or B.Sc. and are as tech-savvy as one might expect, given we’re in the center of the tech universe. You can lift a 20-lb frenchie (you know how they love to eat) with ease, or maybe just a box of pipette tips if there are no frenchies nearby. Although it’s not required, you do get brownie points if you’ve been an Accessioner in a clinical lab before. What is required is your compliance with all lab regulations and procedures. No t is left uncrossed, no i left undotted.
<br><br>
Within your first month, you’ll….
<br>----------------------------------------------
<br><br>
Train with the Dream Team and get up to speed. You know that spending time in a clinical space means training, training, and then some more training. By the time you’re done, you’ll be a pro and might even train a newbie when they start. You’ll be so fast and efficient at receiving, unpacking, processing, and recording samples that we’ll come up with a name for your streamlined process. Also, we’ll be able to build WAY more awesome box forts in the office. You’ll be a magician that can turn a flurry of samples into labeled batches for processing.
<br><br>
Within your first quarter, you’ll…
<br>-----------------------------------------------
<br><br>
Know our SOP requirements like the back of your hand, and you’ll use that information to manage sample storage inventory. On your watch, all samples will have a place to call their own, and you’ll have the address to each. Your lab space will be so clean that we’ll make jokes about eating off it (and DEFINITELY NOT eat off it, because it’s still a lab after all). If there is any non-conformance that you notice, you’ll be able to whip up a report so great we’ll want to pin it on the fridge.
<br><br>
Within your first year, you’ll…
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br><br>
You’ll know everything about uBiome! You’ll have the opportunity to work cross functionally with all the teams. There’s no limit to your growth!
<br><br>
uBiome offers competitive salaries combined with generous benefits that include:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Medical, dental, vision and FSA</li>
<li>401(k) plan with matching contributions</li>
<li>Meaningful equity</li>
<li>Unlimited PTO</li>
<li>Subsidized membership to a gym of your choice</li>
<li>Daily lunch service and plentiful snacks</li>
</ul>
Interview Process
<br>uBiome is driven by some of the brightest people in the industry. Our interview process is designed to ensure that we continue to hire the very best. You’ll meet with members of the team you’ll be working with, as well as our leadership team. We have a mix of remote and phone interviews as well as on-site in-person interviews. The process concludes with a flexible paid work trial where you can apply your skills and get to know our team even better.</span>",,"San Francisco, CA"

<br><br>
Artificial Intelligence is a wave that will hit the enterprise whether businesses are ready for it or not - and at Noodle.ai we are growing a Design and UI team passionate about helping our clients make meaning from data and better understand how AI will affect their businesses. Many companies treat AI as a magical black box... we're looking for creative UI engineers who want to help us open that box for our clients.
<br><br>
As a UI Engineer at Noodle.ai, you will collaborate with our Data Scientists, Engineers, Client Service team, and Designers to build the user interface that will help our clients derive meaning from, interact with, and investigate their data.

About you...
<br>------------
<br><br>
You don't fit in a box. You have an eye for design and the software engineering skills to back it up, and you want to leave your creative fingerprints on a quickly growing startup.

Data Visualization is your jam, and you love helping people understand the story hidden in their data.
<br><br>
Beyond coding expertise, you have a strong understanding of how to leverage existing tools to deliver a prototype quickly. Simultaneously, you are able to step back to see the big picture and recognize patterns across client engagements that present opportunities to build meaningful, reusable tools.
<br><br>
At this point in our growth, everyone joining the Noodle.ai team will have a significant impact on the future of the company. If you are passionate about creating, if you have an insatiable intellectual curiosity and a hunger to learn, if you can geek out about new advances in technology, and if you want to be working with an interdisciplinary team that will challenge you, support you, teach you, learn from you, and laugh with you… this might be a fit.

<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people’s personal situations into account, but we know it’s not for everyone.</li>
<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is preferable although not necessary.</li>

<b>More About Us:</b><br>
Notable Labs is a precision medicine company that has a translational drug discovery platform focused on identifying therapeutic options for relapsed and refractory cancer patients.
<br><br>
Our clinical research lab helps oncologists identify personalized combinations of existing FDA-approved treatments for patients. We’ve developed a high throughput robotic flow cytometry lab platform that screens thousands of FDA-approved drug combinations against the patient’s own cancer cells to help predict safer and more effective cancer treatments. Our lab has completed initial feasibility studies with clinicians in relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia &amp; Myelodysplastic Syndrome, with an 84% predictive rate. Focusing on individual patients and existing treatments, we’re working to discover novel uses of drugs and defining mechanisms underlying cancer progression and drug resistance.
<br><br>
Our research and development platform extends our clinical research to drug discovery, testing novel compounds with primary patient samples for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Using our automated, high-throughput, multi-parametric drug screening research platform, industry partners can assay the biological impact of novel compounds on primary cells in a physiologically relevant environment. This helps our partners stratify patients by their predicted responsiveness, increasing the probability of successful clinical development. We are actively partnering with pharmaceutical companies that have preclinical and clinical stage drug pipelines in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, or related hematological malignancies to profile experimental drug activity in patient samples.
<br><br>
Our investors include Builders Venture Capital, Founders Fund, First Round Capital, Y Combinator, several prominent angels and seed-stage funds, and Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, a venture philanthropy firm founded by Steve Case. We have offices and a laboratory in San Francisco’s SoMa district.
<br><br>
At Notable Labs we value diversity and are an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</span>",,"Foster City, CA"

We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles.

<br><br>
ML at Picnic
<br>Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we’re able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We’ll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.
<br><br>
We’ve sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 15,000 different doctors. We’re going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in

At 10am you meet with the coaching team to talk about your daily goals. You then spend the next couple hours crafting conversations with students and updating your student records. At one point, you wait on hold for 15 minutes when you call a school’s Financial Aid Office to find out about a student deadline - but you eventually get an answer and can help your student. At the end of the day, you spend some time writing a guide that helps students cut their textbook costs.</p>
<p>As a part of a growing nonprofit tech startup, you’ll partner with our product development team to constantly develop better student-facing software and coach-supporting tools that make us more effective and empower us to scale.

Who we are:</b></p><p>
MyoKardia is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and rare cardiovascular diseases. MyoKardia’s initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction. MyoKardia has used its precision medicine platform to generate a pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of two of the most prevalent forms of heritable cardiomyopathy – hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MyoKardia’s most advanced product candidate is mavacamten (formerly MYK-461), a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin intended to reduce hypercontractility. Mavacamten is being studied in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, known as EXPLORER-HCM, in patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM. MyoKardia is also developing mavacamten in a second indication, non-obstructive HCM, in the Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM clinical trial. MYK-491, MyoKardia’s second product candidate, is designed to increase the overall extent of the heart’s contraction in DCM patients by increasing cardiac contractility. MyoKardia is currently evaluating MYK-491 in a Phase 1b study in DCM patients. A cornerstone of the MyoKardia platform is the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on individuals and families with genetic heart disease, which MyoKardia helped form in 2014. MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for patients with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.</p></div></span>",,"San Francisco, CA"

<p>
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.</p>
<p>
But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.</p>
<p>
At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&amp;D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.</p>
<p><b>
Our Team</b></p>
<p>
We’re a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded, team of self-starters who show up every day for the same reason: to create an impact on the way the world innovates. Our aim this year at Brightidea is to make it our Best Year Ever and we plan to accomplish that through our creative, focused, ambitious, and humble approach to change the way corporate R&amp;D teams run innovation challenges.</p>
<p>
Anyone entering our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you can identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful than this could be the perfect team for you to add your contributions to and shine in.</p>
<p>
Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate.

We do not use Tableau (nor others like it) so if these tools are a key source of your technical skills, this probably isn’t the right role for you. Also, this role is customer facing, so exceptional communication and storytelling capabilities are a must.

<ul>
<li>Wrangle and analyze very large data sets to extract insights for our clients</li>
<li>Develop tools for data pre-processing, information retrieval, and analysis automation</li>
<li>Develop presentations to deliver marketing strategies that “activate” new audiences to facilitate growth</li>
<li>Meet with clients to present recommendations and to generate new business for Aki</li>
<li>Write white papers to demonstrate deep marketing expertise in specific business verticals</li>
</ul>
<b>Requirements:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>2+ years of consulting (or similar) experience using data to help clients improve their marketing or corporate strategies</li>
<li>Strong grasp of Python for data manipulation and analysis</li>
<li>Business acumen and intuition that enable high quality hypotheses to explore</li>
<li>Excellent communication skills with ability to craft stories that convey Aki’s unique value proposition</li>
<li>Interpersonal skills to work with teammates from varying backgrounds to translate business needs into analysis requirements</li>

<br><br>
Necessity is the mother of invention
<br>Philo was born in a Harvard dorm room, where cable TV wasn’t offered and the over-the-air broadcast couldn’t penetrate the walls of the 300-year-old brick residence halls. The founders of Philo wanted to watch TV around campus, so they wrapped their room in aluminum foil to boost the signal, and connected it to a server to stream it over the campus network.
<br><br>
We’ve moved from aluminum foil to silicon
<br>Our technology may have changed, but our mission is the same. At Philo, we are building the TV experience we wanted for ourselves. Today, hundreds of thousands of students can use Philo to watch all the live and recorded television they love on all of their favorite devices, and that’s just the beginning.
<br><br>
Company and Culture
<br>We’re a small team that puts our product experience first. We foster a flexible work environment that is supportive but allows for autonomy so that everyone on the team can help us build towards our vision. Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish. We ship to production multiple times per day and keep unnecessary process to a minimum so we can maintain our pace of rapid development. We value pragmatism, having pride in our work, and deep transparency at all levels.
