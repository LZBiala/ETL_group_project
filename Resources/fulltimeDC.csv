The candidate will contribute to various research, data analysis, capacity building, and communication activities led by SDA. SDA’s activities interconnect disciplines at the nexus of economics, environment, farming systems, geography and policy analysis to improve the welfare of the poor through a productive, sustainable and profitable agriculture. By taking advantage of a common data standard - from georeferenced household surveys to remotely-sensed satellite imagery and scenario modeling analyses- in regions with traditionally limited data availability, SDA bridges the divide between quantitative analysis and policy.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that the RA will work on various projects SDA is involved in, including Africa Research In Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (RISING), International Dietary Data Expansion (INDDEX), and Gender-sensitive, Climate-resilient Agriculture for Nutrition (GCAN ). Through action research and development partnerships, Africa RISING aims to create opportunities for smallholder farm households in six Sub-Saharan Africa countries to reduce poverty, hunger, and undernutrition through sustainable intensification of their farming systems. The INDDEX project is designed to fill the information gap on the ability to quantify a population’s food and nutrient consumption and dietary patterns, critical factors for effective food security and nutrition policymaking and programming. GCAN aims to assist practitioners and experts in collecting and analyzing climate science and other data to improve understanding of the linkages between climate, nutrition, and gender, as well as to identify innovations and approaches for sustainably improving productivity, nutrition, climate resilience and gender equality.</p>
<p>This is a one-year appointment based at IFPRI Headquarters in Washington, DC.</p>
<p><b>Essential Duties:</b></p>
<p>The successful candidate will conduct a range of activities including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul><li><p>Analyze various large-scale microdata collected by SDA team and other secondary sources</p>
</li><li><p>Assist with the preparation of project reports, research articles, proposals, and other outreach materials</p>
</li><li><p>Manage, aggregate, and analyze data (to be) collected through project-specific databases</p>
</li><li><p>Actively interact with various SDA partners, including by traveling to program countries and providing in-country trainings as necessary</p>
</li><li><p>Assist with the planning and implementation of various primary data collection efforts</p>
<p><b>Required Qualifications</b><b>:</b></p>

<li>Experience with Bayesian modeling, Markov chain (MC) &amp; Hidden Markov Model (HMM), predictive analytics, uncertainty models, decision risk, agent-based modeling, etc.)</li>
<li>Demonstrated work, research or educational experience in a field relevant to intelligence analysis; for example, international affairs, economic analysis, military science and capabilities, human factors, industrial analysis, spatial analytics, big data analysis, operational planning, wargaming/exercise planning and facilitation, etc.</li>
<li>Extensive and relevant experience with research methods and data analysis; including a demonstrated understanding of evidence-based behavioral/social science analytic methods, including the understanding of structured analytic techniques, probability theory, decision analysis, statistical and data analysis, signal detection theory, game theory, operations research, qualitative analysis, etc.</li>

<b>Title:</b> Strategy and Research Data Scientist
<br><br>
<b>Location(s):</b> Position Available in Washington DC
<br><br>
<b>Security Clearance:</b> Secret
<br><br>
<b>Requirements:</b> Immediate Opening
<br><br>
Background
<br><br>
This position is based in the United States Agency for International Development s (USAID) Center for Digital Development (CDD), on the Strategy &amp; Research (S&amp;R) Team. CDD is part of the U.S. Global Development Lab, which aims to harness the power of science, technology, innovation, and partnerships to source and scale dramatic breakthroughs that accelerate the achievement of foreign policy and development goals. CDD builds the Agency s technical capacity in the responsible use of digital technologies and data-driven approaches, and supports the public goods, partnerships, and policy change that improve the enabling environment for the responsible use of these building block technologies.
<br><br>
CDD houses a forward-looking think tank -styled team, the Strategy &amp; Research Team (S&amp;R), which conducts research and analysis around the impacts in low- and middle-income country contexts of emerging-technology trends, like machine learning, distributed ledger technologies, Internet of Things, etc. This requires conducting both technically rooted research (e.g. How does this new tech actually work? or What are some of the practical limitations of greater reliance on this technology in USAID s work? ) as well as more sociotechnically rooted research (e.g. What are some of the social, economic, or political impacts of the use of this emerging tech in developing country contexts? ). We seek a Data Scientist to first strengthen S&amp;R s ability to explore emerging technologies and data science tools using technically rigorous and policy-relevant analysis, and second, to apply the most promising emerging technologies to the work USAID does.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Test emerging technologies abilities to acquire, process, manage, and analyze data from a range of sources for improved decision making.
<br><br>
Assist USAID subject matter experts with data science focused analytical thinking for improved planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of programs.
<br><br>
Apply novel data science techniques to priority international development challenges
<br><br>
Collaborate with a cohort of interdisciplinary experts within the Center for Digital Development, including the GeoCenter, Development Informatics, Digital Inclusion, and Digital Financial Services teams.
<br><br>
Strategic Planning, Support, and Capacity Building
<br><br>
Provide consultation to non-technical audiences and develop and implement guidance on integration of emerging technologies and analytical approaches in routine decision making processes.
<br><br>
Prepare high-quality concept papers, background analyses, and policy-relevant guidance to build support for the responsible use of emerging technologies and data science techniques throughout USAID.
<br><br>
Facilitate discussion among key USAID stakeholders to articulate a vision and plan for responsibly integrating emerging technologies and novel data science approaches into planning, delivering, and assessing development programs
<br><br>
Provide training and capacity building services to non-technical audiences on accessing, evaluating, and understanding emerging technologies and analytical approaches in the context of international development programming.
<br><br>
Skills and Capabilities
<br><br>
The Data Scientist will demonstrate experience and expertise in the following technical areas:
<br><br>
An advanced quantitative degree such as Statistics, Bioinformatics, Physics, Math, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or related technical field

Program Overview</b></p><p>
Over the last decade, more countries, cities, and communities have sought to protect economic growth and reduce extreme poverty by better managing the impacts of climate change. With the signing of the Paris Agreement, 192 governments agreed to a global goal on adaptation. Current mitigation commitments have reduced the trajectory of emissions to give us a chance to keep global temperature increase to 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Risks associated with this temperature scenario could threaten our ability to reduce poverty, develop sustainably and achieve well-being and security for all. The decisions we make today could lead us toward a more climate resilient future, or they could undermine food, water and energy security for decades to come.</p><p>
A new high-level Global Commission on Adaptation, led by former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, will launched in October 2018. It will be composed of current and former heads of government and leaders from business, philanthropy and civil society. The Commission seeks to elevate the political visibility of adaptation with a strong focus on solutions. The Commission will develop a narrative that marks a qualitative shift in the way we think about and act on adaptation. It will demonstrate that adapting to climate change improves human well-being and results in better, more sustainable economic development and security for all. It will make the case for the importance of taking climate risks into account and radically changing the way we do development. And most importantly of all, it will show the importance of ensuring that adaptation action and support reaches the most vulnerable.</p><p>
Following its formal launch in October 2018, the Commission will engage in outreach and coalition building within the wider development and adaptation communities. It will also prepare and deliver a Flagship Report at the UN Climate Summit in September 2019. This outreach, coalition building, and report will catalyze a year of action during which Commissioners and partners will inspire governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and civil society to enhance adaptation commitments, mobilize finance and accelerate action.</p><p>
The Commission Secretariat will be co-hosted by the Global Center on Adaptation and the World Resources Institute.</p><p><b>

The Center works across different sectors and cross-cutting issues to define and scale up effective climate adaptation. It does this by mobilizing and convening the global adaptation community through discussion briefs, workshops, webinars &amp; conferences to set the global adaptation knowledge agenda.

<br><br>
Pivotal Labs ( https://pivotal.io/labs ) is Pivotal's consulting team, and a recognized leader in modern software development practices. We work with many of the world’s most influential companies, helping them not only build great software, but fundamentally create a culture of innovation. We also developed Pivotal Tracker, the project management and collaboration tool used by thousands of agile teams worldwide.

<br><br>
Your Day
<br><br>
Product designers at Pivotal Labs ensure we solve the right problems and understand user needs to deliver new or improved products and services that have real impact. We espouse a lean/iterative mentality, and try not to treat design artifacts as precious - the only deliverable we are concerned with is the software.
<br><br>
You are a “full stack” designer in the sense that you are willing to help out on any of the dimensions of design - research, testing, ux, visual, css, etc. It’s ok if you’re not an expert in every specialty! We don’t expect you to know everything - we just want you to be curious enough to want to learn.
<br><br>
As consultants, the goal is to ship products that create real value while enabling the client team to develop skills necessary to take the product home after an engagement with our team - you will be teaching traditional waterfall designers how to fish.
<br><br>
You are working with a cross-disciplinary product team and pair with everyone - developers, product managers, other designers, and your clients. You show clients the value of agile design, and the importance of user testing in making smart product choices.
<br><br>
In the spirit of agile design, you have the opportunity to experiment with process. - do what works, try new things, and stop doing things that don’t work.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<ul>
<li>5+ years experience in related field. Degree or equivalent experience preferred</li>
<li>Have experience designing applications, from consumer-facing to internal tools.</li>

Through our work, we’ve directly and measurably improved the health and financial security of millions of Americans.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
Since 2013, we’ve served more than 300 organizations, run more than 1,000 randomized experiments, built hundreds of models, generated over 6 billion touch points, reached virtually every contactable person in the United States, and driven significant improvements in some of the highest-profile private sector, advocacy, and government programs around the world. Along the way, we’ve developed some of the most innovative tools available in media optimization, reporting, and influencer outreach.</div><div><br>

The Senior Analyst position requires a mix of analysis, leadership and communication.

This role is great for those who have led teams before and are looking to create new connections, or those who have mastered the fundamentals of data-driven analysis and are looking to lead project-based teams.</div><br>
<div>
Senior analysts are project managers with one foot in the data and one foot in the client’s world. As advisers and strategists, you’ll be looking at the big picture but you’ll also need to wrestle with the data itself.

With over 45 years of experience, working in over 60 countries, Population Services International (PSI) is the world’s leading non-profit social marketing organization.

<div>
The Consumer’s Market for Family Planning (CM4FP) will be a new research project designed to provide relevant, high quality evidence on the consumer’s perception of the family planning market in two countries. The design of CM4FP draws on the designs of the FPwatch project for family planning and the ACTwatch project for malaria (http://www.actwatch.info/). The project will collect longitudinal data from all outlets in selected project areas, four rounds of data from women living in the project areas via household-based surveys, and data from clients exiting facilities and outlets in the project areas via client exit surveys. The outlet surveys will collect information about family planning commodity and service delivery availability, price, and market share and the household surveys will collect information from the consumer on family planning use, access, and perception of the supply market to explore local supply and demand interaction. The approach to collecting data from all outlets in the project areas (via a census-based approach) will also be compared to the approaches employed by other large-scale surveys such as PMA2020 and the DHS.</div><br>
<div>
PSI seeks a Research and Program Analyst for the CM4FP research project.
