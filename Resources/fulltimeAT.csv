<br><br>
We are looking for an analytically-oriented Research Analyst to join our firm and assist our client service teams in consulting engagements with leading companies.
<br><br>
About Schireson
<br><br>
Schireson is a data-driven strategy consulting firm with offices in New York, Seattle, Boston, and Austin. We deliver custom strategies and solutions for our clients using a combination of data science, advanced research, and business-savvy imagination. We always aim to do superb work, and we always try to make the experience of working with us delightful. We also try to have fun while we’re doing it.
<br><br>
Our clients are market leaders from a wide range of industries, including media &amp; entertainment, technology, professional services, non-profit, financial services, and automotive, among other categories. We forge deep, on-going relationships with our clients, and in return they trust us to help them navigate their most complex business challenges.
<br><br>
We come from many different academic backgrounds and schools, from BA’s to advanced degrees. Many of us have professional roots in tech and marketing, and our collective previous experience spans music, design, entrepreneurship, market research, venture capital, investment banking, management consulting, and even YouTube sketch comedy.
<br><br>
About the Research Analyst Role
<br><br>
As a Research Analyst, you would be part of a team working on client consulting projects. You would support Consultants, Managers and other senior staff members throughout client engagements and help ensure that they have an amazing experience in working with us.
<br><br>
<b>Your responsibilities would include:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Help manage research projects through the entire lifecycle – survey design, managing outside vendors, data analysis, and presentations.</li>
<li>Write and edit survey documents.</li>
<li>Manage vendors involved in survey data collection.</li>
<li>Perform data analysis in Excel and other statistical packages to identify key insights in the data.</li>
<li>Design and build presentations for clients.</li>
<li>Support senior staff members in work sessions and presentations with clients.</li>
<li>Help create interactive data tools that are delivered to clients, such as market simulation tools built in Microsoft Excel or other platforms – you would be provided training in how to create these, but prior experience with tools like Excel is a plus.</li>
</ul>
<b>The ideal candidate will have:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>A degree (or working towards a degree) in a field related to business, information systems, social science, or design/engineering. A quantitatively-oriented major or course work is preferred.</li>
<li>Coursework and/or experience in marketing is preferred.</li>
<li>Some background in statistics.</li>
<li>Proficiency in Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint).</li>
<li>Superb communication and presentation skills.</li>
<li>Ability to think strategically, analytically, and proactively about diverse business problems.</li>
<li>Passion for managing the quality &amp; accuracy of research instruments (e.g. surveys) and analytics, including checking your and others’ work.</li>
<li>Experience multi-tasking in a fast-paced – and fast-growing – small company or professional services/consulting firm environment is a plus (but not required)</li>
<li>Experience in a statistical package like SPSS, SAS, Q, or experience in R and Python are a plus (but not required)</li>
</ul>
What’s important to us (and, ideally, to you)
<br><br>
<b>Quality:</b> On the get it right versus get it done scale, we skew more towards “get it right.” But keep in mind that when the most valuable companies in the world are your clients, you will be expected to deliver high quality insights under time constraints.
<br><br>
<b>Curiosity and Intellectual Chops:</b> People at Schireson are smart and intellectually curious across the map, from learning about new music, to where to find the best tacos, to how to visualize data in new ways using R. We like learning new techniques and would love for you to teach us some new tricks. And by the way, it’s OK if you don’t know everything there is to know about R, Python or SPSS.
<br><br>
<b>Personality:</b> This isn’t a typical “corporate” environment - our offices are very casual and we give our employees virtually unlimited flexibility in scheduling their work. But you should be able to handle that and thrive with the freedom. We respect and appreciate the unique and interesting extra- circular activities you might have outside of work. We value the diverse and dynamic people that make up our team, and look forward to working with similar type people.
<br><br>
<b>Life/Work Balance:</b> We pride ourselves on benefits such as unlimited vacation days, productivity bonuses, vacation bonuses, excellent health care and truly amazing company retreats. This is all to say that we think happy people both inside and outside work, make better employees. We ask that you work hard and kill it at your job; we’ll be happy to make your life a little less stressful and more fun.</span>",,"Austin, TX"

Our team integrates ML and NLP expertise with enterprise software to deliver innovative ML/AI solutions. This position is specifically for experts in the areas of data science, machine learning and statistics. We work in a dynamic environment where, depending on the complexity of the problem, we either use ML and NLP libraries from the public domain in a very heterogeneous set of platforms including Python, C/C++, and Scala, or design our own algorithms, adding to our core capabilities. These ML and NLP algorithms can require special attention to scale, careful utilization of data sparsity to promote faster execution, and deployment to cloud instances. Our task is to manage this complexity with quality engineering.
<br><br>
Required Qualifications
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Stellar background in statistical machine learning and data mining, in areas including but not limited to: online learning, nonlinear optimization, high-dimensional data clustering, classification, regression, ranking, probabilistic graphical models, and deep learning.</li>
