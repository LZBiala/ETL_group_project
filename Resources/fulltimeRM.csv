If any of the above challenges excites you, this is the opportunity for you! Azure IcM and Communications team is looking for an engineering leader and manager to lead our DevOps bot team.

<p>At Microsoft scale, intuitive interaction and collaboration between service teams, DRIs, incident managers and Communications managers are the keys to ensure we can handle live site outages efficiently and effectively. This requires a natural user interface that can let engineers interact with the system anywhere, anytime and integrations with system like Microsoft Teams to build collaboration capabilities directly into the daily tools people use. Based on the SREBot Azure SRE team initially created, we are forming a DevOps bot team in the IcM and Communications team. The vision of the team is to create a self-learning bot with natural language interface for DevOps scenarios such as operating cloud services, monitoring services, manage live site incidents, mitigate live site issues, etc. We plan to build this bot in an extensible and community-driven model so that every team can plug in their custom knowledge and skill to make it their own with minimal effort and maintenance cost. Having a DevOps bot increases collaboration, learning and knowledge sharing within and beyond the engineering team and can integrate various development and operation tools in one central place with high level of automation and natural interaction. We also envision the bot to be self-learning and become the knowledge base for the teams by learning from the interactions and history.</p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Responsibilities</b></h2><p>
As the engineering manager of the DevOps bot team, your responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>

In addition to the DevOps bot, our team also owns IcM (Incident Management System) and communication services for both internal Microsoft On-Call engineers and external Azure users. IcM is a mission critical service, the cornerstone of our efforts to enable every Microsoft service team to run an efficient and automated live site, without the need of a dedicated operations staff through automation and advanced tooling. The Incident Management Service enables the automated management of incident lifecycle and is directly responsible for impacting key metrics like Time to Engage (TTE) and Time to Resolve (TTR) for live site incidents. Having all Microsoft service incidents together enables us to run data analytics and machine learning on it and help us detect incident patterns to reduce Time to Mitigation (TTM) and even avoid future incidents. We are heavily invested in the machine learning and intelligence capability to enable Azure and Microsoft service teams to manage their service health efficiently. As the leader driving the interaction and collaboration aspects of our incident management system and other DevOps tools, you are going to play a critical role in our mission to scale Microsoft services with the highest reliability and lowest live site operation overhead.</p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

<p>Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun.
</p><br>
<p>Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today.

Research Intern - Program Synthesis,Microsoft,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>Empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. That’s what inspires us, drives our work and pushes us to challenge the status quo every day. At Microsoft, we also work to empower our employees, so they can achieve more. We believe we should each find meaning in our work and we ensure employees have the freedom and the reach to help make a difference in the world.</p><p>
Microsoft Research provides a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines, to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.
</p><p>Program synthesis is a new frontier in AI where-in the computer programs itself-a synthesizer interprets user intent and produces a script or a program for the task. The user intent may be given as input-output examples, constraints on the program, or other high-level specifications. This is significant because 99% people who own computers do not know programming. Even for programmers, this can provide a 10-100x productivity increase for many task domains, and especially in the areas of data wrangling/preparation and code refactoring.</p><p>
The PROSE SDK is a powerful and flexible framework that uses state-of-the-art program synthesis and machine learning techniques to automate repetitive tasks in a variety of domains. The strength and breadth of the framework is evidenced by the range of Microsoft products that use it, including Excel, Powershell, SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Machine Learning Workbench.</p><p>
Our experience in using program synthesis in practice has helped us identify several unique and interesting research challenges. How does one test and debug programs when a synthesizer is involved? What user experience and programming interfaces are appropriate when the primary mode of interaction is through input-output examples? How can we adapt the generated programs each user's programming style and coding convention? How can we adapt and improve ML techniques to a setting where logical constraints are present? These challenges require both novel research ideas and practical-minded engineering to address satisfactorily.</p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.</div><br>
<p>
Our team is looking for research interns to work on several projects related to the above challenges and several other aspects of the PROSE ecosystem. Below are some specific research directions we are exploring:</p><p>
a) <b>Task-guided string clustering</b>. In the setting of data preparation and data wrangling, strings are clustered with the aim of processing the clusters separately for standardization or analysis. Can we leverage knowledge about this further processing steps to produce better clusters than traditional methods?</p><p>
b) <b>User experiences around program synthesis.</b> The nature of program synthesis is that it expects some level of user involvement and expertise: either in specifying behavior, verifying that the synthesized program meets their needs, or providing a means through which the user can provide additional specifications. How can we surface program synthesis through novel user interfaces to help users effectively complete tasks?</p><p>
c) <b>Generate human-readable and modifiable code.</b> Many current program synthesis approaches are black boxes: they assume that the user is only interested in completing the task, without needing to know the internals of the synthesized programs. However, in domains such as data science, users of the system demand not only want to verify the generated code, they also want to be able to incorporate or extend this code into their programs. How can we synthesize programs that are also human-readable?</p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

What is machine teaching?</div><div>
(Hint: Machine teaching !== Machine learning)</div><br>
<div>
Unlike machine learning where knowledge is extracted from the labeled data, machine teaching allows the teacher to transfer their knowledge to the machine by specifying the patterns in the data they use to make decisions. Through an interactive tool, the teacher provides examples and features to build models quickly in an iterative process. Machine teaching is abstracted from the machine learning algorithms, so machine learning expertise is not required to be successful.</div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Program Synthesis is a new frontier in AI wherein the computer programs itself-the user provides input-output examples or describes intent in natural language and the computer synthesizes an intended script. This is significant because 99% people who own computers do not know programming. Even for programmers, this can provide a 10-100x productivity increase for many task domains, and especially in the areas of data wrangling/preparation and code refactoring (short video: https://aka.ms/prose-showcase). Data wrangling automation is very useful for data scientists who may end up spending 80% of their time wrangling data. Code refactoring automation is very useful for developers who may end up spending 40% of their time in a typical application code migration scenario. Our team is diverse in multiple dimensions, besides drawing talent from 6 different countries!
