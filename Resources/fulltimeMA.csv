Cognitive Systems Engineering / Human Factors Scientist,Charles River Analytics,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><b>Summary:</b><br>
Do you have a passion for technology, finding yourself backing random Kickstarter or IndieGoGo projects or attending tech meetups in your local area? Do have a desire to conceptualize and design technology applications that can disrupt current practices and truly augment and extend human cognitive, physical, sensory, or other capabilities? Have you ever wanted to be a part of the revolutionary projects that you read about coming out of organizations like DARPA? Does working on across a range of exciting R&amp;D projects with the potential to set your own research agenda excite you?
<br><br>
If so then Charles River may be the place for you!
<br><br>
Building end-to-end decision support systems that incorporate multimodal user interfaces for next generation military command and control (C2); prototyping virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) bicycle simulators to study the effects of connected vehicles and novel multimodal human-machine interfaces (HMI) on cycling safety; designing and developing endlessly scalable modeling and simulation solutions for live, virtual, and constructed (LVC) training applications; conducting empirical research on the psychophysics and ability of humans to acclimate to virtually augmented fields of vision; studying physiological and psychophysiological signals of human users to understand and predict training or task performance – these are only a handful of the exciting and forward-looking technology applications that Charles River Analytics is currently working on.
<br><br>
To contribute to our growing technical project portfolio, and help ensure our technology-driven solutions are attuned to the needs, capabilities, and limitations of their intended human users, we are seeking an individual with applied Human Factors and/or Cognitive Systems Engineering expertise to serve lead and support technology driven research and design (R&amp;D) efforts across a range of domains and on a variety of platforms and applications.
<br><br>
In this role, you will work with small teams of research scientists, software engineers, and subject matter / domain experts to design, guide development of, and evaluate interactive prototypes that leverage cutting edge technology to empower humans to efficiently and effectively augment their natural abilities.

</div><div>
Collaborate on short and long term independent research projects to support scientific research objectives of the lab. Utilize programming skills to design and implement tools directly related to biological research. Analyzes experimental data, addresses methodological problems in experimental protocols and results.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND AND GOALS</div><div><br>
</div><div>
The Corradin lab is seeking an enthusiastic and motivated individual who is interested in utilizing their big data analytic skills to answer fundamental questions about the genetics of human disease. Determining genetic variants that predispose to common disease provides essential insights into the pathogenesis of human disorders. Rather than impact protein-coding genes, the majority of the genetic risk to disease alters the function of regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are noncoding regions of the genome that play a critical role in controlling gene expression programs. Gene regulation is what enables different cell types of the human body to have diverse functions, thus genetic variants that disrupt this process can have dire consequences for human health.</div><div><br>

Data Scientist - Cancer Dependency Map,Broad Institute,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>The comprehensive analysis of cancer genomes is nearly complete, but leveraging this wealth of information to improve patient outcomes remains an elusive goal. Now, a critical task in cancer research is to predict those genes and proteins that are essential to the survival of a variety of tumor subtypes. Identifying these essential genes would pave the way for developing therapeutics against specific molecular targets, and would highlight specific patient populations likely to respond to such targeted interventions. We are launching a new initiative to find vulnerabilities of cancers dependent on a well-credentialed therapeutic target for which no effective therapy exists, and to discover small molecules that may target these vulnerabilities. As part of this effort, we seek a highly motivated and talented individual with a strong computational background to join the Cancer Data Science team.

Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.
</p><p>The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems.

This is an exciting newly created leadership role and a key member of, and accountable to, one or more Disease Area Decision Boards (DADB) which drive the discovery and development of innovative new drug candidates through proof of clinical concept. This position leads efforts to identify, develop, and drive disease, mechanistic biology and precision medicine approaches for the disease area portfolio leveraging biomarker and technology strategies. The BMD TAH is accountable to the BMD line function leadership team for development and implementation of “fit for purpose” biomarker strategies and providing an effective interface for advancing projects through later stage Development. The BMD TAH leads, through matrix reporting, a dedicated BMD line function subject matter expert (SME) team and a group of TA Biomarker Experts (BME) to advance a broad portfolio of projects. Translational Medicine<br>
Translational Medicine is a global team of physician-scientists and researchers specializing in integrating findings from early drug discovery projects with their own deep knowledge of disease pathways and unmet medical needs. They offer insights on where a novel therapy might have the highest impact on diseases and what research needs to be done prior to clinical testing.<br>
The group has adopted an open and flexible approach to maximize impact on projects. Rather than committing a candidate to one disease area early on, they carry out studies in multiple small, focused patient populations. They then follow the science to identify patient groups who show the most promising therapeutic response. Often this leads to the exploration of rare diseases that are genetically well defined and have few effective treatment options.<br>
<br>
“We’re not wedded to, nor are we held down by, our disease focus areas, so we can really concentrate on capturing emerging science and driving it towards addressing unmet needs.”<br>
Evan Beckman, Global Head of Translational Medicine, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research<br>
<br>
The Biomarker Development (BMD) group works in close partnership with Novartis and external translational biologists, physicians and project teams to develop precision medicines such that the right patients get the right dose of the right medicine at the right time. Through its world class people and high performing culture, BMD delivers fit for purpose integrated biomarker plans leveraging diverse expertise and knowledge in genetics, genomics, imaging, protein and cellular biology, digital devices, human tissue research, and state of the art data sciences. Our innovative spirit enables the development and application of cutting-edge technologies which address key clinical questions across many disease area strategies. Our high quality methods and data are critical in clinical development to define disease stage or progression, predict the safety or efficacy of medication, select a group of patients who would benefit most from a given therapy, and identify additional clinical indications suitable for a drug, across all indications outside of Oncology. BMD comprises a global group of ~110 associates in Basel Switzerland, Cambridge Massachusetts, East Hanover New Jersey and Shanghai, China.<br>

"Deputy Director, Machine Learning",Sanofi,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>The candidate for Machine Learning will develop and immediately apply novel machine learning and computational biology-based approaches for vaccine R&amp;D at Sanofi Pasteur. These models span every contemporary learning task: from natural language processing for sentiment analysis, to reinforcement learning tasks (delayed reward and credit assignment), to high-dimensional regression for optimum design, and structured prediction for vaccine composition. Particular focus will be towards (1) developing heterogeneous models and methods that link immunological and clinical outcomes to the biology of vaccine components, and (2) developing models to guide business behaviors and outcomes. The candidate will operate within the newly formed Design Sciences group in the FluNXT “Biotech” within Sanofi Pasteur.</p><br>
<p>
S/he will have an advanced mastery and practical experience with developing and applying complex machine learning and similar modeling solutions.

LINCS Postdoc Fellow,Broad Institute,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>Joint LINCS Fellow - Broad Transcriptomics and DCIC (Mount Sinai)
</p><div>The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute has generated over 2M gene expression profiles
<br>
using the L1000 assay, while the LINCS DCIC has harmonized this data into several tools which feature
<br>
numerous complementary datasets. These efforts over the first 3 years of the Phase II of the LINCS
<br>
consortium have been very successful in making the data accessible and queryable. The clue.io portal,
<br>
developed by the Broad to access the LINCS L1000 data, has already accumulated over 1,500 users who
<br>
have executed thousands of queries in just the past 6 months. At the same time tools developed by the LINCS
<br>
DCIC, for example, the L1000 query app L1000CDS2 which appeared online since early 2016, has seen over
<br>
4,000 users so far who submitted over 400,000 queries.
<br>
In summary, users within and outside of the LINCS consortium are able to access and analyze the
<br>
L1000 data and now the challenge has moved to the interpretation and application of query results for
<br>
biological discovery.
<br>
One approach to tackle this challenge is to select a tractable number of biological hypotheses and conduct lab
<br>
experiments to validate hypotheses derived from LINCS analysis. While experimental validation is attractive in
<br>
principle, there are pragmatic hurdles—clearly there are more hypotheses from the LINCS L1000 data than
<br>
any one individual investigator can progress toward validation in their own web lab. Hence, our goal is to
<br>
develop concrete experimental follow-up workflows to guide the wider community how to proceed with
<br>
validation of L1000 inspired hypotheses. Ultimately, successful validation of even few hypotheses can serve
<br>
as convincing exemplars to the wider community about the quality of data and the methodologies developed by
<br>
the LINCS consortium.
<br>
By virtue of being in the midst of the core analytical teams at the Broad Center for Transcriptomics, and at the
<br>
LINCS DCIC, the LINCS fellow work will also include coordinating workshops, webinars, and other training and
<br>
outreach efforts that will bring more experimentalists to utilize LINCS resources for hypotheses generation.
<br>
Specific Tasks and Responsibilities for the LINCS Joint Fellow
<br>
<ul><li>Develop benchmarks for experimental validation of LINCS L1000 inspired hypotheses
</li><li>Develop benchmarks for the L1000 imputation model; in particular assess ability to infer
</li></ul>knockdowns by shRNAs/CRISPRs of single genes. Generate synthetic RNA-seq data for all
<br>
L1000 conditions. Impute L1000 results for missing conditions. Employ advanced machine
<br>
learning algorithms including deep learning and compare those to simplers methods such as
<br>
PCA, linear regression, and elastic nets.
<br>
<ul><li>Using the MSigDB and Enrichr databases, develop a suite of well validated signatures that can
</li></ul>be tested on current algorithms and used to promote further analytical improvements. These
<br>
include transcription factor and kinase perturbations followed by gene expression analysis using
<br>
microarrays, RNA-seq and L1000. Such datasets can be used for benchmarks by asking which
<br>
method recovers the kinase substrates or transcription factor targets more robustly. This task
<br>
will require manual curation of published studies.
<br>
<ul><li>Extend the L1000 data to unaddressed areas of biology
</li><li>L1000 probes are human specific, but there is a lot of useful perturbational response data
</li></ul>collected from model organisms. It would be useful to develop procedures that will enable
<br>
researchers working on a non-human system to query LINCS L1000 data. The fellow will
</div><div>develop a human ortholog automatic conversion system to prioritize L1000 signatures for
<br>
queries from expression signatures from Mouse, Rat, Worm, Fly, Zebrafish and Yeast.
<br>
<ul><li>Develop biologically intuitive visualizations of the L1000 perturbation data; assess regions within
</li></ul>these maps that are densely populated with small-molecule profiles and areas that are
<br>
untouched by the current pharmacopeia.
</div><ul><li>Experimental workflows
</li><li>Identify interesting relationships between drugs and genes by matching drug perturbations with
</li></ul>single gene perturbations. Explore connections through literature review and consistency across
<br>
cell lines, concentrations and assays.
<br>
<ul><li>Identify secondary (lower throughput) assays that can be used to validate L1000 inspired
</li></ul>hypotheses. These would range from straightforward measures of mRNA (e.g., RT-PCR) to
<br>
phenotypic assays to animal models. Write protocols for specific examples.
<br>
<ul><li>Progress at least 10 compound/genes through secondary assays by performing such
</li></ul>experiments at the Broad Institute. Cost for such experiments will be covered by other funds
<br>
and technical assistance will be provided.
<div>Mentoring Plan
<br>
The LINCS fellow will be based at the Broad Institute but will be traveling for short visits to Mount Sinai every
<br>
four months, and potentially to other DCIC sites. The fellow will be jointly supervised by Drs. Subramanian and
<br>
Ma’ayan who will be meeting with the fellow jointly in three-way meetings for one hour bi-weekly. The fellow
<br>
will also participate in all laboratory meetings weekly at both sites. The Ma’ayan Lab meetings will be joined
<br>
through video conferencing. Dr. Golub, co-PI of the Broad center, and a clinician, will advise on approaches to
<br>
experimental follow-up. The fellow will be asked to take the Coursera LINCS course online as part of their
<br>
training. The fellow will also participate in all LINCS and BD2K related face-to-face meetings, general activities,
<br>
and working group calls. The fellow will present their progress through those venues as platform presentations,
<br>
posters and webinars. It is expected that not all goals listed above will be achieved during the time period.
<br>
Different aspects of the project will be advanced based on the fellow’s skill set, interest, and potential impact.
<br>
Qualifications
<br>
<ul><li>A minimum of a Ph.D. in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology or related field
</li><li>In-depth understanding of nucleic acid and protein biochemistry
</li><li>Prior hands-on experience with nucleic acid and protein purification, experimental synthetic and

creative and driven scientist interested will be thoroughly considered
<br>
<ul><li>Strong oral and written communication, data documentation, and presentation skills

Computational Biologist I (Functional Genomics),Broad Institute,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>The Broad Institute's Klarman Cell Observatory (KCO), directed by Aviv Regev, is an effort to systematically define cellular circuits within and between cells in tissues to better understand health and disease. The KCO builds on breakthrough technologies such as single cell genomics (e.g. single-cell RNA-Seq) and on interdisciplinary collaborations across the Broad and beyond.
</p><p>Advances in human genetics, spurred by genome wide association studies (GWAS), have provided critical new insights into the genetic basis of autoimmune disease. Beyond the GWAS era, fine mapping of disease risk loci and full exome sequencing have pinpointed specific genes and variants causally linked with disease. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial genomics, now provide an extraordinary opportunity for comprehensive identification of cells and their states associated with autoimmunity and how genetic variants impact disease phenotypes. This systematic approach stands to provide tangible clinical insights into how genetic variants influence disease pathophysiology and to inform innovative therapeutic approaches.
</p><p>The study of human genetics promises to broaden our understanding of disease risk and pathological drivers of disease; however, there exist many limitations in connecting genetic loci to pathogenic traits. Immune cells reside within a complex multicellular ecosystem. The diversity of immune cells and their interactions affect disease progression and drug response and resistance, and present opportunities for more precise diagnostics and therapeutics. Therefore, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of the cells that depends on expression and function of genetic variants, their spatial organization and functional relationships.
</p><p>This position involves computational analysis for a large-scale and impactful project, which aims to generate comprehensive and integrated atlases of autoimmunity This person will help develop new computational methods, apply existing computational methods, interpret results within a biological context, and integrate analysis practices from groups at Broad and around the world.

Computational Biologist,Broad Institute,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p><b>We are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with computational background to join the CGA Cancer Resistance team. We have undertaken an ambitious 5-year project aimed at discovering the basis of drug resistance in cancer. While cancer treatments (including chemo-, targeted- and immuno-therapies) work for months or years, cancers eventually recur. In most cancers and treatments, the causes of drug resistance are not yet understood.
</b></p><br>
<p><b>There are a range of questions at the core of resistance: (i) What are the drivers of resistance ( genetic and/or epigenetic)? (ii) What are vulnerabilities of resistant cells? Novel therapies may exploit these vulnerabilities. We look for vulnerabilities using CRISPR, gene knockout, and small molecule screens of resistant and sensitive cell lines. (iii) Are there mutational mechanisms that contribute to development of resistance (e.g. APOBEC or MSI)? (iv) What can we learn from the dynamics of clones under drug selective pressure? Can we use sub-clonal structure and dynamics to identify multiple resistance mechanisms in a single patient? (v) Can we predict resistance mechanisms that will develop based on tumor type, treatment, genomics of tumor and patient i.e. can we find biomarkers of the resistance mechanism? (vi) In which cases can we predict effective therapy combinations based on the initial biopsy?
</b></p><br>
<p><b>We plan to characterise the mechanisms of resistance through genetic characterization of patient tumor samples (germline, pre-treatment and post-resistance) and functional genomics using drug and CRISPR screens of cell lines. As a member or this team, you will collaborate with scientists and engineers in a collegial work environment with intellectual rigor. By applying your statistical and machine learning skills to multimodal cancer data, you will drive the generation and testing of hypotheses leading to new biological insights in cancer resistance. This project is a rare opportunity to contribute to one of the most important and challenging problems facing cancer medicine today.
</b></p><p><b>CHARACTERISTIC DUTIES
</b></p><p><b> Design and execute data analysis strategies to support research projects involving multimodal cancer datasets.
</b></p><p><b> Together with other team members you will develop new methodologies for integrative analysis of functional and genomic data.
</b></p><p><b> Explore novel data representation modes with emphasis on integrating diverse data types.
</b></p><p><b> Analyses typically consist of the application or development of computational tools to a) assess data quality, b) characterize germline and somatic variants, and c) quantify how these variants impact tumor evolution and resistance to therapy.
</b></p><p><b> Present ideas and results to the multi-disiplinary members of the Cancer Genome Analysis Group. Prepare written reports and
</b></p><p><b>presentations for internal use as well as presentations at conferences.
