Airborne Imaging Spectrometer Calibration Scientist,National Ecological Observatory Network Inc,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>Battelle and its affiliate, Battelle Ecology, Inc. manages and operates the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) project, which is solely funded by the National Science Foundation. A 30+ year project dedicated to understanding how changes in climate, land use and invasive species impact ecology, the observatory’s scientists and engineers are collecting a comprehensive range of ecological data on a continental scale across 20 eco-climatic domains representing US ecosystems. Our teams use cutting-edge technology, including an airborne observation platform that captures images of regional landscapes and vegetation; mobile, relocatable, and fixed data collection sites with automated ground sensors to monitor soil and atmosphere; and trained field crews who observe and sample populations of diverse organisms and collect soil and water data. Once structures are completed, a leading-edge cyberinfrastructure will calibrate, store and publish this information. The Observatory includes more than 500+ personnel and is the first of its kind designed to detect and enable forecasting of ecological change at continental scales.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JOB SUMMARY</b></p>
<br>
<p>The Remote Sensing Team within NEON operates three Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) payloads as an integral part of the observatory infrastructure. Each payload consists of advanced remote sensing instrumentation, including a high-fidelity imaging spectrometer, a waveform-LiDAR and a high-resolution digital camera, in order to provide long-term, quantitative information on land use, vegetation structure and canopy chemistry over the NEON sites locations and other sites of opportunity.</p>
<br>
<p>The Remote Sensing Team is currently seeking a calibration scientist who will be responsible for the instrument calibration and data quality assessment of three airborne NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS) systems. The position is located in Boulder, CO, and will report to the Remote Sensing Team Lead. The Calibration Scientist will lead the laboratory-based radiometric and spectral calibration, and field-based calibration validation of the NIS systems. This includes quantifying the calibration uncertainty and developing improvements to the calibration equipment and protocols.
</p><br>
<p>The Calibration Scientist will also work closely with the Remote Sensing Science Team to refine procedures for verifying the quality of Level-0 NIS data, develop novel algorithms to support the calibration and production of NIS data products, and assist in routine processing of NIS data products. The successful candidate will produce reports and publications of NEON designs, procedures, and protocols and is highly encouraged to collaborate with NEON staff and the research community in the application of airborne remote sensing to continental-scale ecology. The ideal candidate should have considerable knowledge and experience with the fundamental principles and calibration of airborne and/or spaceborne hyperspectral imaging systems.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>
<br>
<ul><li>Perform the spectral and radiometric calibration of three airborne hyperspectral imaging systems that were built by NASA JPL and are equivalent to the AVIRIS-NextGen spectrometers.</li><li>

Insight and Results</i> – We will teach you how to analyze data, and explain patterns/insights to clients – you will learn how to explain and influence using logic and data. We aim to help clients reallocate time and money from business activities that don’t work, to marketing tactics that deliver value to the brand.</li><li><i>
Communication</i> – Finally, and critically, you will be exposed to regular communications with clients; eventually helping manage client calls on both Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager and Media/DoubleClick Engagements. Listening and understanding each client’s individual needs, requirements and expectations is something that you are going to learn over time.</li></ul><p>
Also, overtime:</p><p>
– <i>Project Management</i> – You will be trained to project manage the activities and tasks in-between client calls.</p><p>
– <i>Strategic Planning</i> – Preparing monthly and quarterly presentations to synthesize what has been completed to date and provide plans through the next quarter.</p><p>

LASP MO&DS Division Director,University of Colorado,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><div><div><b>Position Overview</b></div>
<div>
The Director of the Mission Operations and Data Systems (MO&amp;DS) at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder, Colorado provides vision and leadership for an outstanding team of professionals and students. This LASP division carries out space mission operations, develops and operates software and data systems, and supports information systems for LASP’s world-class space research program. The MO&amp;DS Division Director reports to the Director of LASP and serves as a member of LASP’s Business Committee, which provides strategic oversight for LASP.</div>
<div><b>
LASP Background</b></div>
<div>
LASP is a CU-Boulder research institute, specializing in space-based scientific research in planetary, atmospheric, solar, and space physics. From its origins in 1948, LASP has matured into the preeminent university research institution for conducting space-based scientific research, providing a unique synergy of expertise in space science, engineering, spacecraft and instrument operations, and software development. Scientists at LASP pose theoretical questions and design missions to answer these questions; engineers at LASP design and build the instruments and spacecraft to conduct these missions; and Mission Operations and Data Systems (MO&amp;DS) personnel develop and manage the systems to test and operate these spacecraft and instruments, process raw data into scientifically relevant data products and make these products available to interested scientists and the public, support the diagnostic and scientific analyses of data, and manage the information technology systems used in all branches of LASP.</div>
<div><b>
MO&amp;DS Division Description</b></div>
<div>
The LASP MO&amp;DS Division is a leader in spacecraft and space instrument operations, and currently employs about 100 professional staff and 40 students. The Division supports several Mission Operations Centers and Science Operations Centers for the day-to-day operations of NASA spacecraft and instrument missions. LASP is one of only very few university-based mission operations centers, performing mission operations for NASA satellites totaling more than $1.5 billion in value.</div><div>
Our highly skilled mission operators monitor and control the spacecraft and their on-board scientific instruments. Software engineers design, develop, and implement software to support all MO&amp;DS activities, and carry out the processing, analysis, distribution, and archiving of mission data. Information Systems staff implement and manage computing technology for all LASP personnel, applying expertise in networks, architecture, systems administration, and information security. We involve students in every aspect of the division, including training and certifying undergraduates to operate spacecraft.
